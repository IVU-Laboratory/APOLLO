DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any\\ndata.\\n\\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,\\nthe 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable\\nmarketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails\\nlegally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch, much more.\\n\\nThere are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\\n\\n  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n  =======================================\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how\\nit goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out\\nonly 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing\\nreceive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much\\nbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people\\nmay send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each).\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.\\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each\\nfor a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and\\nordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\\neach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report #3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is\\n10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out\\n5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)\\nEmails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport #5.\\n\\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half\\nmillion).\\n\\n  Your total income in this example is:\\n  1..... $50 +\\n  2..... $500 +\\n  3..... $5,000 +\\n  4..... $50,000 +\\n  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00\\n\\n  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\n  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\n  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\n  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.\\n\\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,\\nor 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\\neach or more?  There are over 500 million people on the\\nInternet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people\\nmay do just that, and more!\\n\\n  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n  ===================================================\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there\\nare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of\\nfree ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD\\n# 2 as you go along.\\n\\nFor every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\\nReport they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day\\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails\\nthey send out, with your name and address on it, will be\\nprompt because they can not advertise until they receive the\\nreport.\\n\\n  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\n\\nNote:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.\\nChecks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash\\nis wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in\\nthe envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER\\nand the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,\\nyour NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper\\n'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your\\ncountry.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n=============================================================\\n\\n\\nReport 1: The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On \\nThe Net ...

My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  \\nI am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make \\npretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled \\nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the \\nwhole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \\npercentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody \\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later \\nshe jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, \\nand was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \\nthe thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within \\n3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days \\nshe had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I\\nhave joined Jody in her ''hobby''. \\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n===============================================================\\n\\n'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make \\nup my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that \\nI am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \\nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \\nleast get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my \\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large \\n6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this \\ndeal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply \\nisn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.\\nDan\\nSondstrom, Alberta,\\nCanada\\n================================================================\\n\\n'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later \\nI wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no \\nidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until \\nI was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed \\nthen it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I \\nmade a six figure income on my first try and all the money came\\nwithin 22 weeks''. \\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n================================================================\\n\\n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money \\nwith little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions \\ncarefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My \\nfirst month I made a substantial income and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanks to internet''. \\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n\\n================================================================\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON\\nYOUR ROAD TO GENERATING EXTRA INCOME! \\n================================================================\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\nThe sender or participants of this marketing program cannot\\nverify any monetary claims made in this document, nor do they\\nassume responsibility for same.

I am (jerry kaboreEsq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his   supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during   the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your\u2019s faithfully,\u00a0jerry   kabore\u00a0(Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.

ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. \\nMy husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. \\nMy husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. \\nDuring my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. \\nbefore my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. \\nI am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. \\nI hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. \\nWhen I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. \\nFor now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. \\nI will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. \\nThank you and God bless you and family. \\nMRS LOI C.

I actually decided to contact you due to the \\nurgency of this transaction.\\nPROPOSITION;\\nI discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our\\nforeign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of\\nan automobile crash. He actually deposited this funds amounting to\\nUS$40,000,000.00 (fourty million united states dollars), for safe\\nkeeping in my company here in Nigeria. Company file records shows that the \\nfunds was actually for a project. Our late costurmer wanted to start a multi \\nmillion Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA in the near futur,before his \\nsudden and untimely death. As such since his death none ofhis relations or \\nnext-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this property as the heir, \\nthis basically the reason why I have\\ncontacted you.
