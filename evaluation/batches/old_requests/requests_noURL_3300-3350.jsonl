I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to Live, according to medical experts.\\n\\nI have not particularly lived my Life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on \\nmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all these as I now know that there are more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\\n\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I \\nwould live my Life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that \\nGod has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and \\nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few \\nclose friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided \\nto give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some \\ncharity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my \\nhealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.\\n\\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and \\ndistribute the money which I have there to charity organization in \\nBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. \\n\\nHence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended \\nwith what I have left for them.\\n\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $20,500,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.\\n\\nI have set aside 15% for you, then 5% for any expenses insured.\\n\\nGod be with you.\\n\\nSALIM IBRAHIM\\n\\nNOTE: PLEASE I WISH TO SINCERELY ADVICED THAT I CAN BE REACHED ON MY WEBMAIL ADDRESS BELOW:\\n\\nsalim_ib@myway.com\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at [URL]http://frenchdog.ru[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section \\nof AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. \\nWith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA.\\nMANAGER:\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.\\nEmail: zatajoseph@netscape.net\\n\\n\\nI know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to\\nworry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium\\navailable to seekfor foreign assistance in a business.\\n  I am MR JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA. from the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB),\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.   This business request may seem strange, but\\nI crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am\\nconvinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to\\na money transfer.\\n  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with \\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr.Robert Rice  made a numbered  time (fixed)\\ndeposit for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars\\n)in  my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his\\nforwarding address but got no reply.\\n  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.Robert\\nRice and his wife Mrs. Mary Rice died in the plane crash On October\\n31, 1999, (an  Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers\\non board as you can  confirm it yourself via the website below: \\n\\n [URL]http://www.greatdreams.com[/URL]\\n\\n On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a\\nWill and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I\\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr.Robert\\nRice did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his\\nofficial documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.\\nThis sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over\\nwith the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever\\ncome forward to claim it according to African law, at the expiration\\nof (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\\nSenegal Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner\\nto  stand as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Rice so that the fruit of\\nthis  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\\nGovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\\nimmediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will\\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in\\nplace as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of an attorney\\nfor the drafting and notarization of the Will and obtain the\\nnecessary\\ndocuments and letter  of probate administration in your favour for\\nthe transfer.\\n  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide\\nwill  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\\nbeneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for\\nus to share in ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you.. There is no\\nrisk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and\\nmy position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful\\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply\\nimmediately via the private email address below, upon your\\nresponses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant\\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction.\\n   Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that\\nthis  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\\nshall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the\\nfollowing  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer\\ninto your bank account:\\n   1.) The beneficiary's name.\\n   2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\n   3) Your address.\\n\\nAwaiting your Urgent Reply via my private\\nemail:zatajoseph@netscape.net .\\n\\nThanks and God bless,\\nMR JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA.\\nMANAGER:\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

The Fondazione Di Vittorio, established 1977 by the\\nMulti-Million groups and now supported by the Economic Community for West\\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), United Nations Organization (UNO) and the\\nEuropean Union (EU) was conceived with the objective of human growth,\\neducational, and community development.\\n\\nTo celebrate the 28th anniversary program, The Vittorio Foundation in\\nconjunction with the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS),\\nUnited Nations Organization (UNO) and the European Union (EU) is giving\\nout a yearly donation of US$1,000,000.00, (One Million  United States\\nDollars) to 100 lucky recipients. These specific Donations/Grants will be\\nawarded to 100 lucky international recipients worldwide; in different\\ncategories for their personal business development and enhancement of\\ntheir educational plans. At least 15% of the awarded funds should be used\\nby you to develop a part of your environment. This is a\\nyearly program, which is a measure of universal development strategy.\\n\\nThe objective is to make a notable change in the standard of living of\\npeople all around the Universe (From America to Europe, Asia to Africa and\\nall around). The Vittorio Foundation has been assured of highest\\norganization standard courtesy of the United Nations. It is our belief\\nthat we can achieve a great positive change in the general welfare of the\\nuniverse through this program. That is why the foundation is doing\\neverything possible to get all recipients notified of their donation.\\n\\nNote that your country is not the only country that is benefiting from\\nthis donation. Beneficiaries have been chosen from countries from all\\ncontinents. The idea of this donation is that within ten years from now,\\nthere will be notable richness among many unusual people around the world.\\nThis will give many people the opportunity to get their lives to a stage\\nwhere they had always wanted.\\n\\nKindly note that you will only be chosen to receive the donation once,\\nwhich means that subsequent yearly donation will not get to you again.\\nTake time and thought in spending the donation wisely on something that\\nwill last you a long time. Recipients are only eligible to be awarded this\\ndonation once.\\n\\nBased on the random selection exercise of internet websites and millions\\nof supermarket cash invoices worldwide, you were selected among the lucky\\nrecipients to receive the award sum of $2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars) as charity donations/aid from the\\nVittorio Foundation, ECOWAS, EU and the UNO in accordance with the\\nenabling act of Parliament. (Note that all beneficiaries email addresses\\nwere selected randomly from over 100,000 internet websites or a shop's\\ncash invoice around your area in which you might have purchased something\\nfrom).\\n\\nYou are required to fill the form below and email it to our Executive\\nSecretary below for qualification documentation and processing of your\\nclaims.

This\\nmeans that your qualification number will be reffled to know the\\norganisation (ECOWAS or EU) that will handle your payment. You are to keep\\nthis whole information confidential until you have been able to collect\\nyour donation, as there have been many cases of double and unqualified\\nclaim, due to beneficiaries informing third parties about his/her donation.\\n\\nFinally, all funds should be claimed by their respective beneficiaries, no\\nlater than 15 days after notification. Failure to do so will mean\\ncancellation of that beneficiary and its donation will then be reserved\\nfor next year?s recipients.

Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:\\n\\nI. Background:\\nShengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. ([URL]http://www.sinopec.com[/URL], as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. \\n\\nII. About us\\nShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff. The factory mainly produces oilfield special equipment such as beam unit, Spiral-seam submerged-arc weldedsteel pipe, sucker rod, line pipe, casing, tubing, plastic compound pipe etc. It produces 200,000 tons of line pipes, 1 million meters of strengthened plastic compound pipes, 500 beam units, 2.5 million meters of sucker rods, 12,000 tons of PP gas pipes and 50,000 tons of oil tubings yearly, and has become important pipe base in Shandong and Shengli Oilfield. Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.\\nThe Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.\\n\\nIII. Content of the project\\nIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from114 to 339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.\\n\\nIV. Product specifications\\nFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7\\nFor delivery: grade of steel are X52X60X70, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7.\\n\\nV. Economic Analysis\\nThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.\\nThe break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.\\n\\nVI. Plans for cooperation\\nWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:\\na. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35\\nb. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30\\nc. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10\\nd. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25\\n\\nTo meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.\\nWe would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.\\nFor additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt reply.\\n\\nSincerely yours, \\n\\nTony Leung\\nProject officer\\n\\nTel: +86-546-833 9362\\nFax:+86-546-832 9817\\nMobile: +86-133 4505 3225\\nEmail: tony@mpbdy.com\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

In my department we discovered an \\nabandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US \\ndollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. \\nANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire \\nfamily in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash \\nyou can visit this site: [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that \\nthe money can be  release to you as the next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for \\nit and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed \\ndormant fund.\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a \\nforeigner and a Burkinabe like me  can not stand as next of kin to a \\nforeigner.\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your \\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to \\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply \\nfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a \\ntext of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the \\ntext of application form,I will like you to send me the following \\ninformations.\\n1.

This led to his bank \\naccounts in my bank and abroad being frozen.\\nNow, as a matter of urgency, we need your assistance in the remittance \\nof the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a \\nbank in South Africa, which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your \\nfavorable response and consent in this deal.\\nThe amount is US$22.5 Million United States Dollars, which was deposited \\nby Mr. Tony Yengeni before his arrest.

GODWIN AKWESI TEL: +233 208216645 FAX: +233 27621073 Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation;  and //[URL]www.nativefederation.org[/URL] The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together, so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response. You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.
