Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be\\namazed at how confused many people get by them as well.

I never have, and I don't see any\\nreason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to\\nsend out viruses to people.

They're a pain.\\n\\nWell, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends\\ndo.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I\\nknow, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty\\nothers have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of\\nthem for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which\\nemail addresses are already approved and avoid using others.\\n\\nPlus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email\\naddress from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new\\njob info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to\\ntell them about your new job email address?\\n\\n -Mike\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one. Want to find out more about PGP? You can get the software from: PGPfreeware  GnuPG (GPG)  Bring the following:    *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)    *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key. Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

I sit corrected. I guess we could argue if it's even beta quality(I'd say I have about a 50/50 chance of reports being submitted), but I don't think that would be productive. :-) /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\                                Patrick Greenwell          Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

I installed it before I knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is \"gnome-core\" vs. \"gnome-session\" but I can not remember. Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except updated. There has not been a major change to \"gnomehide\" in a while, I suspect Havoc's work went into Limbo then. -- That's \"angle\" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Certainly  Frequency of messages does _not_ let you draw valid conclusions about the understanding of the issues at hand of the sender. IMHO it's sometimes even inversely proportional. > Marc is an active and prolific contributor to SA (gee, look, his name's  > even in the credit's page on the website!). This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules. That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort. But in his place I would have (hopefully :) reevaluated my arguments in the face of, as I saw it, massive rejection of his idea what constitutes spam. Maybe this list can return to discussing technical topics.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get... can't read \"flist(totalcount,unseen)\": no such element in array     while executing \"if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} { \tFlagInner spool iconspool labelup     } else { \tFlagInner down icondown labeldown     }\"     (procedure \"Flag_MsgSeen\" line 3)     invoked from within \"Flag_MsgSeen\"     (procedure \"MsgSeen\" line 8)     invoked from within \"MsgSeen $msgid\"     (procedure \"MsgShow\" line 12)     invoked from within \"MsgShow $msgid\"     (procedure \"MsgChange\" line 17)     invoked from within \"MsgChange 4862 show\"     invoked from within \"time [list MsgChange $msgid $show\"     (procedure \"Msg_Change\" line 3)     invoked from within \"Msg_Change $msg(id) $show\"     (procedure \"Msg_Show\" line 7)     invoked from within \"Msg_Show cur\"     (\"eval\" body line 1)     invoked from within \"eval $msgShowProc\"     (procedure \"FolderChange\" line 55)     invoked from within \"FolderChange inbox {Msg_Show cur}\"     invoked from within \"time [list  FolderChange $folder $msgShowProc\"     (procedure \"Folder_Change\" line 3)     invoked from within \"Folder_Change $exmh(folder)\"     (procedure \"Exmh\" line 101)     invoked from within \"Exmh\"     (\"after\" script) which is probably related to my not having an \"unseen\" sequence anywhere (certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I tried this new exmh ... Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace that with.   There's obviously a way as the \"Sequences\" menu does this. The \"Mark Unseen\" menu entry in the message \"More\" menu is still wanting that function as well...   | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to   | display the other sequences. Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen, top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc... I have space for more sequences, in the \"unseen\" window, as long as they remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall off the bottom, and not be shown). I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring, just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or other decorations, but made \"sticky\" - the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around and do I can see when new mail needs processing). I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to the \"sequences to always show\" and \"sequences to never show\", a preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current. This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message, it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is packed, sorted, etc). I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains \"unseen\" and \"urgent\". It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder happens to have defined.   A \"New sequence\" entry would also be useful (to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist, which can be done now using \"Search\" and the pick interface, but is clumsy that way) Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ... syntax error in expression \"int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))\"     while executing \"expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))\"     (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsg\" line 46)     invoked from within \"Ftoc_FindMsg $msg\"     (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsgs\" line 5)     invoked from within \"Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids\"     (procedure \"Ftoc_PickMsgs\" line 5)     invoked from within \"Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)\"     (procedure \"PickInner\" line 13)     invoked from within \"PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}\"     (\"uplevel\" body line 1)     invoked from within \"uplevel #0 $cmd\"     (procedure \"busyCursorInner\" line 8)     invoked from within \"busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets\"     (procedure \"busyCursorHack\" line 32)     invoked from within \"busyCursorHack $args\"     (\"cursor\" arm line 1)     invoked from within \"switch $busy(style) { \ticon\t\t{busyIcon $args} \tcursorAll\t{busyCursor $args} \tcursor\t\t{busyCursorHack $args} \tdefault\t\t{eval $args}     }\"     (procedure \"busy\" line 3)     invoked from within \"busy PickInner $cmd $msgs\"     (procedure \"Pick_It\" line 51)     invoked from within \"Pick_It\"     invoked from within \".pick.but.pick invoke\"     (\"uplevel\" body line 1)     invoked from within \"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]\"     (procedure \"tkButtonUp\" line 7)     invoked from within \"tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick \"     (command bound to event) It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference. Looks as if something is now saying \"1 hit\" when before it didn't, or similar.   | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a    | week or so ago. Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background? Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere, the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide). Hope this helps. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus. For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.   But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say. The P2P evolution Regardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage.  \"Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,\" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. \"P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally.\"  Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. \"Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides.\" Observers say it's a renaissance. \"P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,\" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. \"But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use.\" Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance.  \"But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,\" he says. Working together To underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops. \"We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,\" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications. Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure. And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers. Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph. \"P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,\" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. \"The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing.\" And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product. P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P.  \"Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,\" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation.  \"Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,\" Duran says. \"One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that.\" Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data.  \"P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,\" Duran says. \"It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P.\" That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing. \"P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,\" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi. And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it. \t\t\t\t\t   Copyright 2001 Network World, Inc.
