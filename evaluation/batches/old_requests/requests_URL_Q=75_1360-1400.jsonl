Red Hat maintains binary compatability across major releases.   Its server management tools are heavily Python, and becoming  more so.

He did confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue. A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts. If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP if that will provide better performance.

I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of\\ndieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the\\nnext few weeks..\\n\\nIn preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core\\nfor the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless\\nap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop\\n\\nI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the\\ncard, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether\\nhub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the\\nwebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some\\nmore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)\\nbut all in all a smooth move.\\n\\n\\nNow the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of\\nfunky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,\\nessentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get\\ngoofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between\\nthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting\\n11mbs and at least 60% goodness.\\n\\n\\nSome cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works\\ninthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a\\nmicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear\\ncat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad\\nthing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I\\nhope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )\\n\\nOk, enough testing for tonight.

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier currently : 1. Leave your current kernel as-is 2. Get the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem, NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm. Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind. I see it more as a \"one size fits all\" achievement in the general case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules you'll ever need. Make that \"one size fits many\" then if you want ;-) Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

Indeed, my usual login is \"dude\" (and has been since long before \"The Big Lebowsky\" came out ;-)), and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code my home directory when being compiled :-( For instance : [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/gentoo | grep dude /home/dude/ [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude /home/dude/redhat/tmp/xine-root/usr/share/locale These should probably be considered bugs in the program's build process (especially for xine, look at that!), I'll report them upstream if/when I have some time.

Um...  I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include  keyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not  require kernel-2.4.18-10, so that's ok. > Matthias -silent --  ...

Sure thing :) I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a \trpmbuild --recompile  --without oss --without isapnp (I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)). Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package installed.  I've added a flag \"kernsrc\", that also can be used --without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way to do that. I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs  don't help much. Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules from source.  It created the /dev files and all. Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec: rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp --without kernsrc But I get this: ==[long successful compile snipped]===================================== warning: File listed twice: /dev/adsp warning: File listed twice: /dev/amidi Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: /bin/sh /bin/sh rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(interp): /bin/sh /bin/sh Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(post): /bin/sh Requires(postun): /bin/sh Requires: alsa-kernel = 0.9.0rc3 /sbin/depmod Processing files: alsa-kernel-0.9.0rc3-fr4_2.4.19 Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires: alsa-driver = 0.9.0rc3 kernel = 2.4.19 Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root error: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound RPM build errors:       File listed twice: /dev/adsp       File listed twice: /dev/amidi       Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound ======================================================================== Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.    It is not in the filesystem, anyway. I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line in alsa-driver.spec: cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/ And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.

Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr... ugly!

Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not listed in the %files section. I should remove them manually as part of the build process... or maybe the new \"%exclude /path/to/file\" in the %files section would do, but I don't know how older versions of rpm would handle it. On my (null) build system, I've simply set the variable : %_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0 Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

After some adjusting and testing we were able to run SiSoft Sandra CPU  and Memory benchmarks and Pifast benchmark smoothly when the CPU was  running at 3917MHz. We raised the FSB one more step and managed to run  succesfully SuperPi benchmark while CPU was running at 3998MHz. The  result was 39 seconds.

Yeah, but these would be different cases relating to copyright infringements, not about ISP's blocking mail or not. --- Lars Hansson ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing  real-time communications platform!

It should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today. Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume things work differently than they do.
