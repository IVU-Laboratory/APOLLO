Please bear with me let me introduce myself. I am\\nBarrister Tony Abbas, the attorney to Late Engr Alex, a National of your\\ncountry, who owned a metal producing factory (Metalco Enterprise) in Nigeria\\nand a personal friend died and left behind his deposit in a finance house\\n(GLOBAL SECURITIES & FINANCE COMPANY) valued at $14.5Millon (Fourteen Million\\nFive Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only).\\n\\n    My relationship with Engr.Alex started in 1999 when I was working\\nwith the security company as a Legal Adviser, Marina branch. We met in my social\\nclub's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said security\\ncompany where he deposit most of his treasures some few weeks later,making me\\nthe Legal officer to the account which he operated until his unfortunate\\ndemise.On the 31st of March 2001, Engr.Alex, his wife and their two children\\nwere involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately\\nlost their lives.\\n    After the incident i contacted Engr.Alex sister (Ms Martha Stevens)\\nwhich was his beneficiary/next of kin but unfortunately before she\\ncould claim his estate she too died in September 11, 2001 terrorist\\nattack at the world trade center in the United State Of America. See\\n[URL]http://edition.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n    Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of Engr.Alex\\nextended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for\\nover 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the\\ndeceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.500,000 (Fourteen\\nMillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) can be paid to you and\\nthen you and I can sharethe money.70% to me and 30% to you.The request of a\\nforeigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that My\\nclient was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as a next of kin to a\\nforeigner.\\n\\n    I am ready to re-negotiate the mode of sharing with you.Thereafter I will\\nvisit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the\\npercentages we agreed upon.If you find this proposal suitable for you do get\\nback to me with the following informations Your full Name and Contact\\nAddress,Your private telephone Number Your Age Your Occupation and Position.\\n\\n    All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal\\nthrough.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement\\nthat will protect you from any breach of the law.

In an account that belongs to one of our \\nforeign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July \\n2000) in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane \\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody \\nis coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury \\nas unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \\nbusiness and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i \\nwill visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages \\nindicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the \\nmoney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax \\nor email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice \\nthat this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any \\natom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as \\nyou receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nSALIF ZONGO\\n\\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to \\nmove very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you \\nfinish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well \\nover this business.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Messenger: appels gratuits de PC  PC ! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

Can you be my partner on this? \\n\\nINTRODUCTION OF MY SELF \\nAs a personal consultant to him, authority was handed over to me in transfer of money of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to an European private bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. \\n\\nWhile I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president. \\n\\nYou can catch more of the story on this website: \\n[URL]http://www.yukos.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.opendemocracy.net[/URL] [URL]http://newsfromrussia.com[/URL] \\n\\nYOUR ROLE: \\nAll I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable the European bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. \\n\\nThe transaction has to be concluded in 2 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is out on bail. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will provide you with the details. \\n\\nThank you very much. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nOlsom Berghart(Mr) \\n\\nNB: Please contact me through this secure email: berolsom@indiatimes.com \\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"JPN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

Je pense que vous \u00eates digne de la recommandation de ma pri\u00e8re, donc une personne honorable de confiance avec qui je peux faire des affaires. Ainsi je n'ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 me fier \u00e0 vous pour des affaires simples et sinc\u00e8res. Je suis Ti\u00e9moko Yoro Wahonon Fran\u00e7oise la fille unique de mes d\u00e9funts parents M. et Mme Yoro Ti\u00e9moko Edmond Ivoirien d'origine Burkinab\u00e9. Mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait un grand fermier et exploitant d'or \u00e0 Abidjan la capitale \u00e9conomique de la C\u00f4te d\u2019 Ivoire. Ma m\u00e8re est morte quand j'\u00e9tais toute petite et depuis lors mon p\u00e8re m'a pris en charge. Deux mois avant l'assassinat de mon p\u00e8re mort le 30 octobre 2006 sous mes yeux, il m'a secr\u00e8tement appel\u00e9 et m'a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la somme de 5 millions d'Euro dans une compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ici \u00e0 Abidjan, Cet argent qui repr\u00e9sente le fruit de ces ann\u00e9es de travail devrait nous permettre de quitter le pays pour recommencer une vie loin de la politique de notre pays qui devenait dangereuse. Malheureusement mon p\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 froidement par des hommes arm\u00e9s. Pr\u00e9sentement j'ai du fuir ma maison pour \u00e9viter d'\u00eatre aussi  victime de la barbarie de ces gens, je vous \u00e9cris afin que vous puissiez m'aider a retirer cet argent de la compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et le s\u00e9curiser dans votre pays. Aussi j'aimerais que vous puissiez m'aider \u00e0 vous rejoindre en vue de recommencer une nouvelle vie comme souhait\u00e9e par mon d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re.Le colis a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 comme bien de famille. La compagnie ne conna\u00eet donc pas le contenue du colis. Si vous \u00eates dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 m'aider je vous ferais parvenir plus de pr\u00e9cision afin que vous puissiez rentrer en contact avec la compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ainsi dit, je suis dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 vous offrir 15% de mon h\u00e9ritage en compensation pour votre effort apr\u00e8s le retrait de ces fonds de la compagnie et son transfert dans votre compte bancaire. En outre, indiquez moi vos options pour m'aider sachant que pour moi, j\u2019ai la foi que cette transaction peut se faire le plus vite possible. J\u2019aimerais avoir votre point de vue sur cette question et cela selon votre disponibilit\u00e9.

I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may \\nbe capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten \\nmillion, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to \\none of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in \\na plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at \\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines \\nasociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nUnclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during \\nthe business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues.\\n\\nThere after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \\naccording to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \\ntransfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to \\nthe bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your \\nreply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free \\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \\narrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nI expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nHoping to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR .ABU TOPIA\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRetrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search ! \\n[URL]http://desktop.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\n\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost.

I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing \\nand Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou \\nBurkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to \\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both \\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues.

We (myself\\nand the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collect\\nthis money the Nigerian government will confisticate it and\\nsomeone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we have\\ndecided to contact you, hoping you will prove to\\nbe a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to the\\ndeceased customer to claim the total fund from his account\\nwith the bank so that the proceeds of his account can be\\npaid to you.\\n\\nBe assured that this transaction is risk free and we will\\ndo all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backing\\nit requirs so that both parties will be protected from\\nbreach of the law both locally and internationally.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with the\\nnext step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim to\\nyour account. The entire transaction should be completed\\nwithin 10 official working days from\\nthe day the bank receives your initial application.\\n\\nWhen you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mail\\nsignifying Your acceptance or otherwise, include your\\nprivate Telephone numbers for more explanation\\nand confidential communication.\\n\\nWaiting to hear from you soon,\\nBest Regards,\\nK.
