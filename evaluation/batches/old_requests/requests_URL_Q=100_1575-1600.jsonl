That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background than others. In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed. unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that), it doesn't need a different background as well. I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of horizontal, and see what turns up.   | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined   | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color. OK.   | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for   | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet. In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about. A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an \"all unknown\" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)   | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?   |    | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you. Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better (for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a bit too similar.   I ended up using *sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2 The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which is probably safer for generic use. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \\nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \\n\\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \\nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \\ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \\nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \\ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \\nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.\\n\\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\\n\\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \\nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \\nAfter all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to \\nlearn methods and technics.\\n\\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \\nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \\ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \\n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \\nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \\nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\\n\\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \\nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \\nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \\nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \\ndb connection/password to the main web application.\\n\\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \\nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \\naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \\nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \\napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \\nbackground).\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nThank you,\\nMario Torre\\n-- \\nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\\nSee [URL]http://www.fsf.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Bowman  Special to ZDNet News August 22, 2002, 12:05 PM PT URL: [URL]http://zdnet.com.com[/URL]  <%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20[URL]http://zdnet.com.com[/URL]>  *In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially  the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has  declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose  who funded them.* In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such  messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could  easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional  information won't be required. The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as  campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the  same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous  political spam. Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had  asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring  financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would  use up too much of the 160 character-maximum. Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from  the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was  supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular  Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade  groups. FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the  commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the  potential to reach more voters. \"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work,\" he said. Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous. Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface. Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as  \"good for America.\" \"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office,\" he said. \"We have free speech on our side.\" --------------080808010909060409040405-- [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
