The first beta of Vipul's > Razor v2 is now available for public download. 1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta. 2)  When you go to the \"Download\" page, it tells you \"Fetch the latest versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages\"  It is not at all clear that these are development packages. The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the word \"beta\" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design \"fact\": USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*) I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test sites. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. rOD. -- Anyway... long story short... ...is a phrase whose origins are complicated and rambling. >> Doing the blogging thang again at [URL]http://www.groovymother.com[/URL] << ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

The callers are then  changed to pass what the function > expects.  In the case of Msg_Change, the  'line' argument is removed > and we only have the msgid argument.  Ftoc_ClearCurrent is now the > first line of MsgChange.  The following patch removes Ftoc_RescanLine in favour of a  Ftoc_RescanLines. It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc  accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it. It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of  falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an  effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence. It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on  folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does  not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic  scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now  corresponds better to what's on disk. Comments appreciated.

I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed >> (especially those with multiple email addresses...). > > What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain. > Ah the great spam debate wages on ... So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-) Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )   Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down. When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to my @hotmail account. I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more knowledgable. My half a cent here... : I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :) Woo hoo!   Law school!)

And, anytime I speak\\nto someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to\\ncontact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be\\namazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to\\nignore the \"please apply\" messages.\\n\\nAs an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the\\naddressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any\\nreason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to\\nsend out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an\\naddressbook, and search out the last email I received from someone and hit\\nreply...\\n\\n>> email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed\\n>> (especially those with multiple email addresses...).\\n>\\n>What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.\\n\\nWell, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends\\ndo.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I\\nknow, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty\\nothers have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of\\nthem for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which\\nemail addresses are already approved and avoid using others.\\n\\nPlus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email\\naddress from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new\\njob info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to\\ntell them about your new job email address?\\n\\n -Mike\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
