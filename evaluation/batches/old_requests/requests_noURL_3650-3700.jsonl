I will start\\nby\\nintroducing myself to you.\\n\\nI am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson Gracious\\nObaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,\\nNigerian National\\nPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that you\\nwill be of a\\ngood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.\\nFor many years of marriage now between me and my husband, I\\nhave\\nnot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.\\nAs a result \\nof the respect given to local tradition culture and custom\\nhere in \\nNigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. With\\nthe situation of things\\nwith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am been\\nthreatened daily\\nby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband s\\nbrothers are not\\nleft outin this matter. \\n\\n\\nThis situation has really affected me psychologically.\\nAs at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,\\nhence I seek\\nyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a long\\nway in getting \\nme settled finally.\\n\\nI want to use this opportunity to move the sum of\\n(US$29.5M) into\\nyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your\\ncountry. This\\nsaid amount was given to my husband as gratification from\\nsome Foreign Oil\\nCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drilling\\nof Crude Oil\\nin Nigeria.\\n\\nAs a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hence\\nhe\\ngave me this money to keep in my personal account so that\\nhe can be\\nexonerated from the eyes of government security operatives\\nand the \\nCivil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body that\\nscrutinizes the activities of all\\ncivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for\\nofficial\\nmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connected\\nwith drugs; money laundry,\\nfirearms and looting which I believe will put fears in you\\nto render the \\nrequired assistance needed from you and consequently\\nwithdrawing your help for\\nsecurity reasons.\\n\\nHence the source of this said money is clean and clear.\\nThis money was deposited in my personalin name, and\\nthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically under\\nthe banking\\nprocedures which could have been the easiest, but because\\nof monetary\\ntransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,\\nthat is\\ndefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move\\nthis money out in cash to any\\ndestination where it will be easy for you to collect under\\ndiplomatic\\nimmunity.\\n\\nThis he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your response\\nand\\nwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish you\\non the next line of\\nacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transaction\\nis 100% risk free,\\nand my husband will not raise any alarm because he will not\\nlike to put\\nhimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, he\\nstands the\\nchange of loosing his job.\\n\\n\\nAs soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm to\\nme\\nthat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you up\\nthere in \\nyour country where I wish to live the rest of my life. I\\nwill be offering \\nyou 25% of this money for all your help at this time of\\nneed, while some\\npercentages has been  set aside for my Brother to\\ncomplement his efforts here. Be\\ninformed that this transaction will not last more than 14\\nworking days\\nand it will be concluded because every arrangement has been\\nput in place.\\nYour negative or positive response will be highly\\nappreciated.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMrs. Rose Obaseki\\n\\n\\n \\n___________________________________________\\n Look Good, Feel Good [URL]www.healthiest.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I came to know you in my private search for a\\nreliable and reputable person to handle this Confidential Transaction,\\nwhich involves thetransfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account\\nrequiring maximum confidence.\\n\\nI am writing to you, following the impressive information received about\\nyou from the chambers of commerce. I believed that you are capable and\\nreliable to champion this business opportunity. In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of $30m US dollars (Thirty million US\\ndollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who\\ndied along with his entire family On August 23, 2000 through Gulf Air\\nFlight 72 with Airbus A320 crashed off, killing all 143 people on board\\nand you can view the site for more\\ndetails:[URL]http://www-tech.mit.edu[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it\\nunless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased\\nas indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make\\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nBank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\\nexpenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me and my\\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMR.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be\\nthe onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of\\nthe countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in\\nNigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for\\nsecurityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ;\\nfortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to\\nairship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery\\nwe willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office,\\nbut for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are\\nunable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you.\\nHere inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means\\nin whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this\\ndecision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of\\nthe totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in\\ncourse ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family. We wish to invest this fund in\\nyourcountry ,this transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded all\\nnecessaryarrangments before contacting you.\\n\\n\\nWe expect your favourable response, indicate your private Telephone and\\nFax numbersfor easy\\ncomunication.
