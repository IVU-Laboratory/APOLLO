In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of\\nUS$20M dollars (Twenty Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of\\nour late foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany)who died\\nalong with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. and please note\\nthat my reason why of contacting is base that this is a deal between me and you\\nonly.\\n\\nBelow is a website which i will apprecaite you go through to read the\\ninformation.\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince then I have made several enquiries to locate any of the above mentioned\\nperson extended\\nrelatives, this has also proved abortive.\\n\\nNow the reason while of contacting you is base on trust to enable me present you\\nas the next of kin so that this fund will be released to you as the next of kin\\nor relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody\\nas come for claiming of the fund and note it will be very easy to convince the\\nbank since I have the necessary legalised documents that backup the fund and\\nwhich will present you the rightful next of kin to the\\ndeceased customer.\\n\\nI don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclaimed after Five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury\\nas unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is\\noccassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Indigen here\\ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nAll I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.\\n\\n\\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will\\nprotect you from any breach of the law.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of\\na foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the\\nbusiness,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charity\\norganisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for me\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the\\npercentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this\\nfund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin\\nof the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your private\\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where\\nin the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the\\napplication . I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is\\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required\\narrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately\\nas soon as you receive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nMr.Stefan Dusza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir,I am Mr.Eric Madu,\u00a0 I got your contact through a friend who attended a trade mission in your country, but I did not disclose the nature of the business to him. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Charles Fredrick with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,000.00(Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:[URL]www.thestate.com[/URL] on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL,and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Fredrick did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$20,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest isbeing rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Fredrick so that the fruit of this\u00a0 old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple,I will like you to provide immediately your fullname and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction.  If you are interested,please reply immediately via the private email address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assitance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me the following,to enable start the process of the fund into your bank\u00a0 account: 1. Your full Name and contact address.2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication. Immediately I recieve a mail indicating your interest I shall send you more details. Thanks and Regards, Mr.Eric Madu.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

I am (Ben Coroma  Esq),asenior staff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I gotyour contact from a tourist from your country who was in this country and transacted a business with our bank. When i was searching for aforeign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one ofour foreign customer  who died along with his entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim hismoney because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next ofkin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money \\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. \\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer ofthis fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, yourbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or emailthe text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any  atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made forthetransfer. \\nYou should contact me on this email (00226-7885 7597)immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear fromyou immediately. \\nYour's faithfully, \\nBen Coroma  (Esq.) \\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always. \\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. \\n I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to \\nprovide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.\\n We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.\\n Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.\\n The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business . \\n There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\n Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n Please upon your approval of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:\\n1.) The beneficiary's name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\n I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.\\n I do not find this move against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot afford to let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and I won't let it pass me by.If you will not work with me let me know \\nand let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. \\n There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.\\n Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:da_sarr@katamail.com or call me on \\nmy private telephone number: +221-4488469 for further discussion.\\nThanks and God bless,\\nMr.David Sarr\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn't even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I've used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt's time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise\\nto teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a\\nmillionaire through successful day trading.\\n\\nYou don't need to know anything about the market, and\\nanyone can do it, with minimum effort.

I know that\\nthe contents of this mail might sound so strange, but I want to assure you that every word of it is true.I am Mr.Abgottspon Ewald, a credit officer with Banque Jacob Safra(Schweiz)AG.I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the \\nplane crash of Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic on February 26, 2004 ,Dimka Ilkova Boskovic from the Ministry of Foreign \\nAffairs,macedonia and also a business woman made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, with a value of Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.You can visit this website:\\n\\n[URL]http://www.rferl.org[/URL]\\n\\n\\nThe board of directors of my bank adopted a resolution and as the accounting officer to Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic I was mandated to provide her next of kin for the payment of this money within 14 working days or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned property. Further investigations revealed that Dimka Ilkova Boskovic did not declare any next of kin in her official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And she also confided in me the last time she was at my office that no one except me knew of her deposit in my bank. So Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that the directors of my bank had planned to invoke the abandoned property decree of 1991 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the period given to me, despairing at the point of exhaustiveness but fortunately, I came across your name. My suggestion \\nto you is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkova Boskovic so that you will be able to receive this funds.\\n\\nHowever, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the deceased. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkova Boskovic. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Be Inform also that we shall share the funds in the ratio 70% for me and 25% for you, while 5% should be for Expenses or Tax as your Government may require. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction \\nwhen I hear from you. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated via my private email address(aewald2000@msn.com).\\n\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nMr.Abgottspon Ewald.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

I was the financial secretary to the Armed\\nForce Ruling Council (AFRC). With my position as a \\nfinancial secretary, I was able to secure up to\\n$146,000,000.00(One hundred and fourty  six million us\\ndollars which i deposited with a finance and security\\ncompany in a country that will be disclosed to you\\nlater as you indicate interest. I wanted to use this\\nfund to context for the post of the president of\\nNigeria in the next republic.\\n\\n\\nImmediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem\\nto Christian when I was preached the words of God\\nthrough my cousin the pastor of my church I then gave\\nmy life to Christ and became a born again Christain.\\n\\nSince I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.\\nSome times I think of the souls I killed when I was a\\nsoldier and the dubious ways I diverted my countrys\\nmoney into my Personal Bank Account. I then decided to\\n\\nseek the face of God for forgiveness and after fasting\\nand prayer through Divine Revelation, the Almighty God\\nrevealed to me that the only way I could have rest of\\nmind is when I used my wealth to do the work of God. \\nI have been thinking of the particular thing to do for\\nmy God before this present civilian president of my\\ncountry set up  a panel(Honourable Oputa Panel) to\\nprobe the Bank Account of the past Military officers\\nlike me. They suceeded in finding out the funds I have\\nin my personal Bank accouts in Nigeria and they have\\nseized all my money.I am still facing their charges\\nbut i have refused to disclose to them that i have\\nsuch money somewhere and they can never find out\\nbecause I want to use part of it to do the work of\\nGOD.\\n\\nI have decided to use part of this fund for charity\\ninstead of loosing it to my government. I am presently\\nunder house arrest and my movement is restricted.The\\nconsignments that contained the money is now\\naccumulating demurage in the country because the\\nagreement time with the security company has passed. I\\nhave been  making arrangement to sneak out and clear\\nit but I can not travel out now.I sent a message to\\nthe security company that I am sending somebody to\\ncome and claim the consignments.I want a honest\\nchristain who will not run away with my money and who\\nwill be honest to use part of the fund for things of\\nGod and let the name of the lord be glorify and so\\nthat I can have rest of mind as the Lord told me.If\\nyou are interested in going to claim the fund,I will\\ndisclose to you where i deposited the money and every\\ndocument to claim the fund will be fax to you.\\n\\nI am still making arrangement to see if I can sneak\\nout of the country with my family.As soon as you claim\\nthe fund,please use half of it for GOD`S WORK and keep\\nhalf of it for me till I come over to meet you.\\nIf you are interested in going,please send to me your\\nfull names,address to submit it to the security\\ncompany as the person coming to claim the\\nconsignments. \\n\\nI look forward to your response\\n\\nGod bless you.\\n\\nDeacon   pastor faith.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________\\nGet Paid...
