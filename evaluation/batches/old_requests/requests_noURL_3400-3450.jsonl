However after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, in conjunction with the council of ministers, they mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately.\\nDuring the above mentioned process, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his\\nentire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa.\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\nPlease I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane Crash:\\n[URL]www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and\\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\nI agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,and 50% would be for me, while 10% will be for expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.\\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us\\n14 banking days because as a banker, I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so that I will send you the text of the application to apply to the bank.\\nYours faithfully.\\nMR ISIAKA AKIDA\\nBill & Exchange Manager,\\nBANK OF AFRICA (BOA)\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nFaites un voeu et puis Voila !

This is just one example of how CMNW \\nmay make company history.\\n\\nOpening China's Door\\n\\nUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, \\nCMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of \\nentrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to \\ndo business worldwide via the Internet.

This\\nis an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest\\nfortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential\\nis being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.\\n\\nCMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... \\nsky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of \\na growth company. \\n\\n*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to [URL]www.freeedgar.com[/URL] *** \\n\\nObviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US \\ncompanies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. \\nBut you can grab the modern day equivalent.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.\\n\\nI need those houses...\\n\\nMost of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use \"unconventional\" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) \\n\\nI'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. \\n\\nIf you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com \\n\\nBest Wishes, \\nJeremy Lessaris\\n\\n\\n847.366.4300\\n[URL]www.synteligent.com[/URL]\\njeremy@synteligent.com\\n\\n\\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\\nwith \"unsubscribe freebsd-ports\" in the body of the message\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Meanwhile, all the whole arrangement and directives \\nneeded to put claim over this fund as the next of kin to the deceased, Upon \\nyour acceptance all the information will be forward to you as soon as you \\nindicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your \\nself to this great business opportunity,In fact, I could have done this deal \\nalone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are \\nnot allowed to operate a foriegn account and would eventually raise an eye \\nbrow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank, \\nthis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who \\nwill forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to \\nthe bank and also present a foriegn account where you will need the said \\nfund to be transferred into, after due verification and clarification to \\ndesignated bank account,I will not fail to inform you that this transaction \\nis 100% risk free, On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be \\nentitled to 40% of the total sum as ratification, while 10% will be set \\naside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer \\nsuch as telephone bills etc,While 50% will be for me.\\n\\n\\nPlease you have been adviced to keep top secret as I am still in service and \\nintend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you, I will be \\nmonitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm the money \\nin your account and ask me to come down there for subsequent shearing of the \\nfund according to percentages previously indicated and further \\ninvestment,either in your country or any other country you may advice me to \\ninvest in.\\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you, I \\nsuggest you get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this \\ndeal.\\n\\nTrusting to receive your urgent reply through my alternative Email \\n:mrs_aicha9@yahoo.fr\\nYour's Sincerely\\nmrs Aicha Ahmed\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Messenger : discutez en direct avec vos amis ! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently \\nmurdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your \\ncountrys Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable \\nperson to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer \\nof fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war \\nveterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their \\nalleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich \\nfarmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is \\nagainst Mugabes rule.\\n\\nThe land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly \\naffected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the  \\nmodus operadi adopted by the government.\\n\\nThis resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and \\nthugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from \\nthe West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their \\ncondemnation of Mugabes Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development \\nCommunity (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this \\nbackground that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have \\ndecided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe \\nanymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can \\nestablish ourselves.\\n\\nJust before my fathers death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to \\ndeposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a \\nsecurity and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. \\nThis money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from \\nthe finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms \\nmachinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in \\nLesotho and Swaziland.\\n\\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of \\nseeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred \\ninto without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our \\nfamilys wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along. \\nI am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries \\nhave almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange \\ndoes not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum.\\n\\nAs a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family, \\nI must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business \\ndoes not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to \\nhelp me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for \\nyour assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the \\nrest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on \\ncommercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance \\nthat you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account.\\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my \\nEMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy \\ncommunication.\\n\\n\\nBest regards,\\nWilliam\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nHave a video conversation in real time - Get MSN Messenger - FREE download. \\n[URL]http://messenger.msn.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir/Madam, \\n\\nSince the present new South Africa. The SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK which over rides all banking system has cut across THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE (MPC) and most banking system. And major policy has been established since the beginning of this year by THE SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK (SARB) On January 1st 2005 as it first annual physical policy. Decisions to cut the policy/ financial institutions to be able to meet up with the world standard banking system were carried out. \\n\\nBasically a Repurchase (REPO) rate by 150 basic points from 10 percent TO 8.5 percent. This was the first Consecutive cut starting from January 1st 2005 which basically affects all banking Sphere which FIRST NATIONAL BANK and most commercial bank were not left out. The declining rate of the Rands to foreign exchanges 8.9 percent to 8.5 percent was a major issue. The Rand initially ignored the interest rate but then Weakened to 7.20/Dollar from the beginning of this year. SARB attributed this to many factors that led to the January 2005 rate cut, such as Subdued inflation from the rest of the world, a strong Rand, an improvement in inflationary expectations and surplus productions.Capacity in manufacturing, prudent fiscal policy and slower growth in monetary aggregates. Millions of Rands and Dollars held with various Bank which are not accountable to taxes, goes a long way in causing CPIX INFLATION which have move below normal rate. Most bank like ABSA BANK, FIRST NATIONAL BANK AND NEDBANK also report that lower interest rates influenced Households consumptions pattern with regards to other interest rate sensitive goods. \\n\\nIn view of all these limitations and constraint the South Africa Government therefore come up with this new 2005 policy for all major bank to summit all dormant Account for a certain period which have not been accountable to taxes to the SOUTH AFRICA RESERVE BANK. As \\nsuch account is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now, it is being speculated that such sum held in such account will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund if no one makes a claim. \\nMy Bank were I work has done a routine check on all dormant account and found out three major account worth million of Dollars that belongs to foreign customers who have died for the past five years. With My position as the Manager of Bills/Exchange at the Foreign \\nRemittance Department and with other three senior colleagues of the Bank we conveniently summit only two to the Government. The committee to review and summit this account was held by me, hence our ability to have submitted only two of this account. The other account we \\nhave planned to transfer the money somewhere and share between ourselves. But we need a foreign partner, since the South Africa inheritance laws and the Banking laws does not allow us to have foreign account. All details of the said deceased are with us. He died along with his wife. It is based on this background that this panel set up to submit such account in my department and I have decided to make an initial contact with you to establish a business relationship to claim the money. In essence, we will like to form a partnership with you where you can then present yourself as the next of kin through your relation as a business partner with the deceased so that the funds can be remitted into your account. We have full access to the deceased biological data which we will furnish you and then use to present yourself as the rightful next of kin which give you a claim to the funds. Note that full details of the deceased how/cause of death, amount in question and when he die are with us.\\n\\nWe therefore expect you to reply to this letter through this email address to discuss the transaction further with you. After receiving your reply, we will contact you and furnish you with more details and the exact steps to take in completing this transfer. For deceased details and information about their death and names view this webiste for your perusal. [URL]http://www.newscotland1398.net[/URL]\\n\\nDECEASED NAME MR. BENJAMIN WAHKYN and Wife MRS.

In \\nmy department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$12m dollars (Twelve \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our for eign \\ncustomer (MR.

It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery  that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and \\nrelease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for \\nsafety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we \\ndon't want  this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \\nof a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the \\nbusiness and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable  the \\nimmediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first  to the \\nbank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application \\nthat i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private \\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location \\nwhere in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of \\nthe application.I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction  is \\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all  \\nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact\\nme immediately as soon as you received this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Faithfully,\\n1. Full Name\\n2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number\\n3.

My name is Mr.Bernard Martin and I work in the International  Operation Department in a Bank here in London. I feel quite safe  dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium  (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it  because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However,  this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated  as such.  At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is  100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT  MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN  ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader. Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge  investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a  matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND  FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London  which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about  this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant  domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED  AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet  investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed  away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will  approve this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the  a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for  the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with  legal claims to the account Holder,  Therefore I need your cooperation  in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in  order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down  now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 -  February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self- made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister  of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from  office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14,  2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated  as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese  capital, for more information please log on to([URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL] I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I  DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE  WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT  BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to\\nmake business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or\\nbeneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into\\nGovernment treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained\\nafter eight years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as\\nunclaimed funds.\\n\\nWe agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while\\nthe balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country\\nfor the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once\\nthis money gets into your account.Please be honest to me and trust is our\\nwatchword in this transaction.\\n\\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free.As soon as you receive\\nthis mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all\\nnecessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has\\nbeen finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your\\nresponse.\\n\\nPlease if you are interested in this project contact me for further\\ndirectives.\\n\\nBest regards\\n\\nMr.Charles Greene\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
