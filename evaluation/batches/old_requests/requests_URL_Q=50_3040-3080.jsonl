Upon maturity, the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month, I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. \\n\\nFinally, I discovered from my client\ufffds contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D\ufffdIvoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.\\n\\nI am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. \\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man\ufffds labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.\\n\\nI wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. \\n\\nIf you are interested, please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email.\\n\\nThanks & Regards\\n\\nDr.David Clovis (Esq.)\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________\\nCerchi un laboratorio fotografico aperto 24 ore su 24?\\nStampa le tue foto digitali su Kataweb e le ricevi a domicilio in 48 ore.\\n[URL]http://www.kataweb.it[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you, view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.\\n\\nI am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with !\\n a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;\\n(i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the \\nforeign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the \\nwhole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is \\nfirst to furnish us with the following through my email address.\\n1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )\\n2.) The beneficiary's name,\\n3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a \\nsmooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria \\nGovernment Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me \\nimmediately through my personal E-mail: uzoromaobi@o2.pl or call me on my \\nreceiving number:234-8058437715 for more details.\\nBest regards as we look forward to hearing from you soonest.\\nYour Sincerely,\\nDR UZOMA OBI.\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at JU-Schrobenhausen\\n- [URL]http://ju-schrobenhausen.de[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

My  >defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan  >disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.  Dear Nicety, As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking  up your computer I'm afraid your \"SOL\" as finding a true solution.   There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts  resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many  programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working  in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a  regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened  and closed several different applications. Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at  [URL]http://www.unix-vs-nt.org[/URL]  What was true back then is  even truer today.  Every current \"worm\" you are hearing about  on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.   So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change  the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of  weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running  I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.  I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and  the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  [URL]http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com[/URL] Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~ I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate  sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well  presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been  a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,  preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a  relationship to it. What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something  related to the url  \"prosperouswomen\" to come up, as this  \"word\" was what caught my attention and caused me to  click in the first place. I feel the book page should be a tool for the \"PW\" page and  not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the  book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.) With these: Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com         and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing  write to us at directions4U@aol.com I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than  copy and paste. Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.  (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~ I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.   Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics  or where we were headed. ~~~~ Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book. Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish  between the links and that which is not. I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also  linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that  link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site. If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a  request message to an aol email address you would get more  requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~ I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.   If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~ With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact  on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences  in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box  with \"Life Changeing Insight\" needs the 'e' taken out of  'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended  to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100  year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of  using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where  or how or by whom it was discovered. The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that  would make the site more effective (on getting people to request  the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in  what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to  order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form  for this just about anywhere. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

Dear Nicety, As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking up your computer I'm afraid your \"SOL\" as finding a true solution. There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts resulting in a locked machine.\u00a0 One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.\u00a0 When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened and closed several different applications. Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.\u00a0 You can read it at [URL]http://www.unix-vs-nt.org[/URL]\u00a0 What was true back then is even truer today.\u00a0 Every current \"worm\" you are hearing about on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. \u00a0So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change the OS.\u00a0 Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of weeks at a time with no need to reboot.\u00a0 In over a year of running I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and the price is right -- free.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        fork ,\\n\\nFrom;Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,\\n         Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\nMy name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la\\n st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc\\n ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.David Kargbou and family. \\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! !!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! = !!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! = INVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! I found this on a bulletin board and = decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through = newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to = this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with = only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must = be a scam\", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. = Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address = stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the = bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 = newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after = thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about = trying it. I figured: \"what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and = $6.00, right?\" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... = Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I = figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my = first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had = made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 = and it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a = total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's = certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the = lottery!!(This is not me but i am\u00a0also making alot of = money)\u00a0Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, = WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so = you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you = that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making = more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! = Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or = download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes = in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus = postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; = it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of = the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive = extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow = these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 = days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and = integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully = adhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order = business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's = a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many = large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. = However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the = income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included = in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get = 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of = paper \"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.\" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills = and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not = be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one = paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 = sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, = your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating = a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate = service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little = skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I = checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they = confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following = addresses: #1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, = KY.40391 #2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 #3) = Brian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 #4) A. Guy , = 6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 #5) Wes Armstrong, 157 = Butternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 #6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box = 1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the = list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes = #1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on = the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep = this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your = amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to = 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the = more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. = This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 = Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these = steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, = and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful = because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their = carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of = integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many = others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to = retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard = copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are = truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 = bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post = is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be = reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar = each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your = name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars = in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the = first six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the = list and you're in business! -----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO = POST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- Step 1) You do not need to re-type = this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the = beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this = document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the = entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank = 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From = the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter = into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step = 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your = postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back = to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching = for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, = discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this = article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and = selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will = be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of = postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're = done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to = do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang = of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! = **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU = WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** that's it! = You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You = may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of = mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent = a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE = ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** Now, each of the 5 persons who = just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at = #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another = $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at = #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, = those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at = #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! = OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM = 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, = that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this = message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per = 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original = investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the = list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out = another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. = And start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even = $60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! The thing to remember is: do you = realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the = Internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! = So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... = People have said, \"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you = the money?\" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there = are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the = Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? = Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands = of those joining the actual Internet.

On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.\\n\\nIf interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.\\n\\nThe informations will be as follows.......\\n\\nBank Name.........\\nBank Address........\\nA/C Name.............\\nA/C Number..............\\nSwift Code No..............\\nRouting Number................\\n\\nI want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly.
