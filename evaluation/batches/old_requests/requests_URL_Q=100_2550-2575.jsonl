In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$39.5m dollars \\n(thirty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that \\nbelongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, \\nGermany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane \\ncrash. for more information about the crash you can visit this site:( \\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and \\nrelease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for \\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we \\ndon't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during \\nthe business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country \\nfor disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable \\nthe immediate transfer of this fund to your arranged, you must apply first \\nto the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of \\napplication form that I will send to you when I hear from you, so I will \\nlike you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and \\neffective communication and location where the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is \\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all \\nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me \\nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\nThe manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of \\nBANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).\\n\\nBest Regard\\nMr Harrison Compaore.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \\ntlphone portable !

I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.\\n\\nDue to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a \u0093contract\u0094 for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.\\n\\nWhen Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. Please, check: ([URL]http://allafrica.com[/URL] Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services. \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Mike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.    \\n\\nThe money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is currently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money. \\n\\nWhat I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have authorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: (miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you.\\n \\nAs soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email address: drben211@yahoo.co.uk  \\nAs you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.\\n\\nKind personal regards,\\nDR.

Please\\nobserve utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that\\nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of\\nus because I shall require your assistance to invest\\nmy share in your country.\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via email.\\nThanks and regards,\\n\\nJames Obulu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ---\\n[URL]http://www.torba.com[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"DEU\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

This \\nbusiness request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you, view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us \\nwith a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an \\naccountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the \\nApex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.\\n \\nI am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a\\n  very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;\\n (i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the \\nforeign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the \\nwhole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is \\nfirst to furnish us with the following through my email address.\\n1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )\\n2.) The beneficiary's name,\\n3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a \\nsmooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria \\nGovernment Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me \\nimmediately through my personal E-mail: uzor5@myway.com or call me on my \\nreceiving number:234-8042137980 for more details.\\nBest regards as we look forward to hearing from you soonest.\\nYour Sincerely,\\nDR UZOMA OBI.\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n----------------------------------------------\\n[URL]http://www.zahnklinik-innsbruck.at[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

After going through some old files in the records I \\ndiscovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the \\nmoney is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will \\nbeforfeited for nothing.\\n\\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Howard Sweeney, a foreigner, a miner and an \\nindustrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since \\n1993 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My \\ninvestigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and \\nthat Mr.Howard Sweeney until his death was the manager Sweeney Coy.(pty). \\nSA. We will start the first transfer with six million dollars \\n[$6,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your \\nside, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your \\naccount.\\n\\nThe amount involved is (USD 29M) Twenty Nine million United States Dollars \\nonly. I want to first transfer$6,000.000 [Six million United States Dollar] \\nfrom this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I \\ndon't know any foreigner.\\n\\nI am revealing this to you with believein God that you will never let me \\ndown in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax \\nnumber including the full details of the account to be used for the\\ndeposit.\\n\\nI need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this \\nbusiness proposition.\\nWith my influence and the position of a bank official whom is working in our \\nfavour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which \\nyou can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our \\nphysical arrival in your country for sharing.\\n\\nThe bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we \\nreceive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you \\ncan come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make \\nthis remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at \\nleast two days ahead of the money going into the account.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \\namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\\n\\nI look forward to your earliest response.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nMrs.Vikki Meade.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nSee their smiles, hear their laughter with Windows Live Messenger! \\n[URL]http://messenger.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
