It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\\nJohn Roberts of the association said: \"It has obviously been very well\\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\\nhorn cut out of carpets.\\n\"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\\nnot get another refit for another year.\\n\"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a\\nlorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.\"\\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\\nwhitening.\\nMr Roberts added: \"The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\\n\"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\\ntake it away again because it was a major job.\"\\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\\n\"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\\nhas not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It\\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.\"\\nAn RCA spokesman said: \"Some people in the country are getting very\\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\\ndon't seem to be doing anything good.\"\\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: \"The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.\"\\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the\\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\\nmaybe me and you, too.\\nBut B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the\\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\\nproto-warriors in the background.\\nYou must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\\nMail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't\\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom\\nwe don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\\nBritish right) as \"Captain Hook\", in articles which usually call for his\\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\\nwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\\nto shut up.\\nBecause we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before\\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\\npersecution.\\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've\\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's\\nscoop.\\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were\\nmeant to do stuff like that.\\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\\ntrue - Hamza is not \"representative\" of British Muslims, as if British\\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\\nrevealed to be rather more \"representative\" than the list of those\\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an\\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.\\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\\ntime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't\\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,\\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\\nfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\\nrepellent.\\nAnd that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\\nis simply the pungency of his views.\\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\\nYou don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And\\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\\nup, therefore, won't make a difference.\\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Lupa\\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\\n \\n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\\n \\n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,\\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\\n \\n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\\n from video footage.\\n \\n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\\n that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.\\n \\n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\\n the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\\n \\n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not\\n grab their reins.\\n \\n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'\\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\\n Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\\n \\n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

That's a steppe too far [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        The Electronic Telegraph\\n\\n Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far\\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \\n \\n \\n So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\\n or sick of Sheffield.\\n \\n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\\n \\n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\\n with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\\n \\n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\\n side.\\n \\n \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant.\\n \\n \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\\n becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.\"\\n \\n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\\n \\n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\\n opening time in the nation's vodka shops.\\n \\n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\\n \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\\n life.\\n \\n \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\\n of whisky for kopecks.\"\\n \\n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\\n halfpenny in sterling.\\n \\n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\\n diehard alcoholics.\\n \\n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\\n \\n \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\\n off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.\"\\n \\n One or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. There\\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\\n Mongolian border.\\n \\n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\\n which they would like to live.\\n \\n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\".\\n \\n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\\n \\n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\\n \\n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\\n climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\\n solve itself\".\\n \\n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\\n \\n \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\\n amongst our citizens.\"\\n \\n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\\n preferred new home.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

According\\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of\\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\\npeople's shape.\\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\\ntaller than his French counterpart.\\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\\nadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.\\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\\nand 66.7 for women.\\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\\n1,047.2mm.\\nThe average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\\navailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\\naverage.\\nThe British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for\\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\\nopen ring pull cans.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established - there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants, but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created  much more easily within the petrochemical industry. Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world  war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants.  Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as  petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication  of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately  matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to  cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants. My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason. Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely  difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen, just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on, for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers. All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh  Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT [URL]http://news.com.com[/URL]  *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that  would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy  surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft   released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every  Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the  right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice   and Industry Canada  , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step  in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to  conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion  draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in  early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,  Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and  combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting  these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the  Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty  , which the country is in the  process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the  possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet  providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and  permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden  electronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In  most circumstances, a court order would be required for government  agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of  Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have  endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty  , which has  drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.  Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted  ,  or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist , a professor at the  University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the  justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems  weak. \"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the  changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to  make changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that's not a particularly convincing  argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,  make that case.\" Geist added that \"there's nothing in the document that indicates (new  powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant  number of cases where police have run into problems.\" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is  compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure  their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention  orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the  Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  , but it  applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. \"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and  Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical  capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national  security agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be  responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center   (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says  the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their  proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not  just Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals  only with computer data.\" EPIC opposes    the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and  does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs  of Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with  personal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The  implementation of such a database would presuppose that service  providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\"  the draft says.

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at: [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too: [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild. As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging for many releases now. I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these rpms do not work on (null). -- That's \"angle\" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

As usual the result is that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-) I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-) Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - Recompile the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm for your running kernel   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - Install this \"alsa-driver\" package - Install the \"alsa-libs\" package - Install the \"alsa-utils\" package Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading : [URL]http://www.alsa-project.org[/URL] (very complete and very good documentation!) Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-) Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) \"by hand\" and insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (\"dmesg\" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default. With \"aplay\" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it! It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the \"alsa-driver\" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!). I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Simply run \"xine -A alsa09\" and off you go!

To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: [URL]www.lindows.com[/URL]  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a \"Friendly-Install\" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of \"bridge\" Windows-compatible programs.

A. Hettinga\"  Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender:  [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL] Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies ([URL]www.ceert.org[/URL] It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. --  ----------------- R. A.

Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal. > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2. > As it > happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. Not correct. Mauna Loa data  and  show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution). > In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: [URL]http://www.grida.no[/URL] (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\"). Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point. > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations. Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away. > Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely > predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative > feedback systems mentioned above. Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous. > Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and > methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule > basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something > that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the > biosphere. Correct. Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: [URL]http://www.grida.no[/URL] Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well. Data on water vapor here: [URL]http://www.agu.org[/URL] > CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent > studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a > passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and improved efficiency is an easy sell. - Jim\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

OS \\nX normally disables screen-capture while the DVD player is running (even if it \\nisn't visible!). I have some home movies on DVD that I'd love to get stills \\nfrom, but I can't -- the DVD licensing board has forced Apple to break my \\nhardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful, \\nto make sure that I never, ever grab a frame out of _Police Academy n - 1_. \\nNice to see that independent software authors are willing to un-break my gear \\nfor me.
