I do not like pop up pagesand therewasone that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimationdid not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeenput into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,whydon't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~Thisis a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funaswell. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name andahost that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm...too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlikethe wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedmefor a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbasedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhereto go.~~~~Thiswas a neat site. The site was original and I could tell that Mrs.T certainlyseemsto enjoy working on her site. The graphics were pretty, or funny,dependingon each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedtheleft rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.Also, I thinkusinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehowthefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothesite content helps when new visitors visit.Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.Onyourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehindthat would work better.Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasiertodeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof whichIvisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,mostofit is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play -goodforsmaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and Iwouldrecommendthis site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTEON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Helpout the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOURfavorite!Youcan help out Teddy at [URL]http://www.links4profit.comby[/URL] taking alookat his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBayDesigns [URL]http://AkkaBay.com[/URL] has designedspecificallyforhim.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi,\\n\\nI'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \\nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \\n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou've probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt's people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.\\n\\nIf you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt's that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \\nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \\nDon't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step \\nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\\nbuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating \\norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.\\n\\nOkay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?\\n\\nNo problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot\\nproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay\\nstarting an Internet business because they have \\nnothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  \\nAfter reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete \\nproduct line in less than two hours!

This seperate guide contains a daily \\nroutine for you to follow with specific, exact \\ninstructions on how to get started.

I'll even\\ninclude 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE\\nif you order NOW!\\n\\nStop wasting your money on auction listing fees, \\nclassifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and \\nnever will!

Presently I'm with \\nmy lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer \\nof the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told \\nme that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that \\nthis money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed \\neach year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless \\nbaby&#65533;s home where I come from.

I am the credit manager in a bank here in the Republic of Benin. I am contacting you with regard to transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a\\ntransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.\\n\\nPROPOSITION;\\nI am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident\\nhimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n\\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in \\nyour favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills and\\nthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. \\n\\nIt may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please\\nacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.\\n\\n1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.\\n2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. We shall be compensating you with 25% on final conclusion of this project, we have set aside 5% for expenses and 70% shall be for my colleagues and I.\\nI intend to retire after the conclusion of this\\ntransaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endevour to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed\\non you,\\n\\nI await your urgent mail to my personal Email:julliet06@3xl.net\\n\\nRegards,\\nMrs Julliet Abrams\\nTel: 00229 07 14 19\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nFaites un voeu et puis Voila !

In my department we discovered an \\nabandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US \\ndollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. \\nRICHARD BURSON from Florida, U.S.A) who died along with his entire family on \\nNovember 1999 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash you can \\nvisit this site: [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that \\nthe money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for \\nit and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed \\ndormant fund.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a \\nforeigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a \\nforeigner.\\n\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your \\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to \\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply \\nfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a \\ntext of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the \\ntext of application form,I will like you to send me the following \\ninformatios\\n\\n1.NAME IN FULL:................................\\n2.ADDRESS:.......................................\\n3.NATIONALITY:...................................\\n4.AGE:.............................................\\n5.Sex..............................................\\n6.OCCUPATION:......................................\\n7.MARITAL STATUS:..................................\\n8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................\\n9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................\\n\\nso i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective \\ncommunication.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application form.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I am contacting you concerning a customer  \\nand an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  \\nfact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  \\nthe contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  \\nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  \\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  \\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  \\ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  \\nto engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  \\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  \\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  \\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  \\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  \\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  \\nespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  \\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  \\nand however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  \\nprime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  \\nby assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  \\nmanagers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  \\nmoney around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  \\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  \\nstood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  \\nmargin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  \\nguaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  \\nmoney be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  \\nrequiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  \\nfunds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  \\nour bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  \\nin order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  \\n9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  \\ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  \\nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  \\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  \\nincidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  \\nmainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  \\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  \\ndeposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  \\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  \\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  \\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  \\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  \\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  \\ndeposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  \\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  \\nwe had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  \\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  \\nthat particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  \\nwas concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  \\nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  \\nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  \\nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  \\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  \\nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  \\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  \\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  \\nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  \\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  \\nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  \\nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  \\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  \\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  \\nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  \\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  \\nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  \\naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  \\nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  \\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  \\nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  \\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  \\ncare, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have  \\npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  \\ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate, this  \\ninvestigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  \\ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  \\nget to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  \\nin my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  \\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  \\nestate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  \\ndeceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  \\nsupervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  \\nof the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  \\nhave considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  \\nor identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  \\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  \\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  \\nthe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  \\nclaim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  \\nprobably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  \\nmoney entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  \\nout of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  \\nThis will not happen if I have my way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  \\nbut I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  \\nbanking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  \\naberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  \\nhuge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  \\nportfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  \\ndirection of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  \\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  \\none unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  \\nthis deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  \\ntransaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  \\nto the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  \\njust customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  \\nidea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  \\nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  \\nforward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  \\nof the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  \\nfamily but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  \\nI am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  \\nto release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  \\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  \\nhalf and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  \\nkin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  \\nproceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  \\nme, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  \\nin claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  \\nforeigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  \\nclaim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  \\nfew days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  \\nfile relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  \\nthe finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  \\nwith these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  \\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  \\nholder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  \\nthe money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  \\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  \\nin this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  \\nyou do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  \\nto you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  \\nnot destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  \\nmay not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  \\ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  \\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  \\nmay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  \\ndictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  \\nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  \\nunderstand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  \\nto face with my destiny.\\n\\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  \\nchance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  \\nmove on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  \\nthis is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  \\nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  \\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  \\nrefusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  \\nknows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  \\ninto the center of relevance in my life, let\u0092s share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  \\nspecifically, through this email account (mr.qin_wang@emanssv.com), if  \\nyou give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a  \\nconclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition  \\nshould you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny  \\nknowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you  \\ncontacting me through our official lines neither do I want you  \\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only  \\nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link  \\nbetween you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are  \\nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line  \\nwith our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this  \\ninstruction religiously.\\n\\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two  \\nkids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what  \\nthe consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured  \\nis nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a  \\nplatter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private  \\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one  \\naccord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has  \\nbeen completed plan a meeting, soon.\\n\\nI await your response.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nQin.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
