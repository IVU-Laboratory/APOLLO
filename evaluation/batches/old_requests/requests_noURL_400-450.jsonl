I've got enough bugs to swat, but I really look forward to it.

I wasn't saying\\nthat MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't\\neasy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way\\nthat \"changed the face of communications\".\\n\\nI'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why\\npeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\\nphone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\\npeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\\nother people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over\\nsending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or\\noffline) photoalbum.\\n\\nI don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\\nright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's\\none of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\\nview part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want\\n\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\\noffers.  I'm not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\\npeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put\\ntogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\\nthey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\\nit's just \"nice\" on occasion.

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what you sent doesn't support packages named \"kernel-smp\"). I'd also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec... probably \"--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp\". Sound good enough? The BuildRequires on \"kernel-source\" will also need to be removed because it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/ More ideas are welcome.

You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to use it. > >If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, >  > With winbloze 9x I used to deltree the winbloze dir and some \"Program > Files\" dirs, and install \"fresh\" instead of upgrade, while saving my > other data.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating \"/\", put your /home/ files back into place and you're ready to go. That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass \"pci=bios,biosirq\" for one of my computers to work for example).

Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse\\nengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular\\nthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third\\nparty or otherwise) was in development.\\n\\nAll of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the\\nprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have\\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\\nplace.\\n\\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.\\nBut when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of\\n\"known\" menu extras from Apple.

The bombes used for Enigma were electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified.

I find it annoying, though, that  alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently  running kernel. So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the \"TARGET_KERNEL\" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at least it doesn't have to be currently running.

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness. 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.   [URL]http://www.picotech.com[/URL] 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn. 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/ What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply \"./configure --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver\" from the alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run \"depmod -a\". Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own kernel. I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a kernel recompiled with ACPI.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument  against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that  they  a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some  sort of autodetection and changing crap) b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because  formats have changed. Red Hat is not \"taking it easy\" on this, it's putting control in the hands  of you, the maintainer of the machine.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put  /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use  the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the  data as is. If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need  to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup  and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over  ssh.  It's the best way to make backups. > These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.     Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.     I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" dumps core.

If you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.   score RAZOR_CHECK 10 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient. If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient. Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA won't do it and avoid the double network hit. However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as Razor1.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating \"Named Objects\", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for \"Named Objects\". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on \"Named   Objects\". - Current types of \"Named Objects\" include:     NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication  \tFramework     AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using \tdigital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain:  - Core: \thard coded root public key, for authenticating top level \tNameSpaces  - Signing Services: \tImplementation of web based signing services \tEnd user hosted signing service  - Example User Authentication Application  - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

You're supposed to just shut up and take it.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net[/URL]\\n\\n===========\\n\\nWho's the real monster?\\n\\n\\nIt seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that\\ndares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're\\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\\n\\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\\nway.\\n\\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\\n\\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\\n\\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's\\nperception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how\\nthey feel about this foolishness.\\n\\n\\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\nDave deflects what he can't take the time to understand\\n\\n\\nIt's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something\\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\\nand looking like fools.\\n\\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\\n\\nPosts a link to something he doesn't understand\\nGet's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\\nDerides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.\\nExpects others to do research for him\\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\\nRealizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself\\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be\\ntrue.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you\\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\\ntrying.\\n\\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It's like that movie The\\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the\\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about\\nyou but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\\nThe ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.\"\\n\\nDave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\\naround.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\\ngood ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell\\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing\\nall the trouble.\\n\\nWe've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking\\namongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.\\nThat's where we're coming from.\\n\\nIf you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an\\ne-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\\n\\n\\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\\n\\n\\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\\n\\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally\\nimpossible:\\n\\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\\n\\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"\\n\\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar\\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\\n\\n\\nIt would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on\\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\\n\\nI'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\\ndeal-stoppers.\\n\\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\\nit!\\n\\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be\\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\\n\\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\\ngetting rejected!\\n\\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\\n'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be\\nnice to him because he's still recovering?\\n\\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\\nfights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your\\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave is Scary on 9/11\\n\\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\\n\\n\\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\\nI'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's\\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\\n9-11.\\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\\nsomeone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\\n\\n\\nWow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:\\n\\nThe man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining\\nbuffoon\\n\\nGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!\\n\\nRelated links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\\n\\n\\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\\n\\n\\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\\n\\n\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"\\n\\nDave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferral log funnies\\n\\n\\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to\\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\\n\\n\\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\\n\\n\\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\\n\\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\\nto patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:\\n\\n[URL]http://tarr.uspto.gov[/URL]\\n\\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\\n\\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\\n\\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\\n\\nTim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the\\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\\nThere's no way to route around them.\\n\\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen's a Permalink not a Permalink?\\n\\n\\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\\npermanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a\\ndefinition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n 9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, \"the No. 1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on [New York's] Upper East Side. \"It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store\" on Madison Avenue, which features \"rich vulnerable women,\" the mag's October issue says. AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting place published, or being cited as the \"in\" place for finding loaded women - or rather, women who are loaded. \"The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and help others find sobriety.

Both can be found here : [URL]http://ftp.freshrpms.net[/URL] I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2. [URL]http://ftp.freshrpms.net[/URL] Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty new features : You can use any of \"--with ldap\", \"--with mysql\" and \"--with postgres\" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set accordingly, and the release tag is changed too. [URL]http://valhalla.freshrpms.net[/URL] (the usual place ;-)) I think I'll use this \"--with \" switch more and more where possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec to enable Pilot support.

He offended conservatives and the\\n# politically correct left with his 1998 novel \"Les Particules\\n# Elementaires\" (\"Atomised\" in English).\\n#\\n# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted\\n# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme\\n# admit he felt \"a quiver of glee\" every time a \"Palestinian\\n# terrorist\" was killed.\\n#\\n# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National\\n# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in\\n# bringing Houellebecq to trial.\\n#\\n# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying\\n# Houellebecq's comments amounted to \"Islamophobia\" and deserved to be\\n# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination\\n# and racism.\\n#\\n# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading\\n# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former\\n# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for\\n# sending Jews to death camps.\\n#\\n# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case\\n# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact\\n# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says\\n# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.\\n#\\n# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour\\n# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the\\n# article before it appeared.\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the\\n# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's\\n# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.\\n#\\n# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached\\n# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to\\n# love.\\n#\\n# Translated into 25 languages, \"Atomised\" incensed France's 1968\\n# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won\\n# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the\\n# world's biggest fiction prizes.\\n#\\n# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.\\n\\n- Gordon\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down\\nin price. Hearing that the only \"officially\" functional Windows player is\\nMusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch\\nis a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why\\ndo we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware\\nunit?\\n\\nAt first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows\\ncompatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides\\nsong management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a\\nbetter option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with\\nalmost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management,\\nvia Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your\\nPC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off\\nApple's officially endorsed player.\\n\\nLori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's\\nSIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of\\nwinferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the\\nfree copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival,\\nI enjoyed dinner with the eSellerate gang, with a discussion about GnomeTomes\\nand what the future holds.\\n\\nEvery time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is.

Crosspaths is\\ntechnically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of presence in almost every\\nmajor city in the country. If you're a dialup user, you may want to take a\\nlook at their offerings, regardless of where you live.

At first\\nGeorge and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-\\nadjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George\\nand Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty\\ncocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as\\nquickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology\\nprofessor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy\\nDennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic\\nexchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find\\nthemselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.\\nThroughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely\\nchoreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead,\\nalternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.\\nThankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost\\nunadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and\\nimpeccable timing. At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with\\nHumiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how\\nabout a little round of Get the Guests?\" This provides some idea of the\\nprecarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to\\nfinish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is\\nTaylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok,\\nI will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not\\nhave been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with\\nthe chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying\\nslaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax\\nor look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is\\nnot a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a\\nmemorable film that will stick with you for years to come.\\n\\n  * Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only) \\n  * Format: Black and White, Widescreen Anamorphic, Closed Captioned \\n  * Sound: (Dolby Digital 5.1) \\n  * Production Notes \\n\\nReview by Brett Trout\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWALLPAPER  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**purple flower forWallPapers** by tatosh  \\n![](/images/blank.gif) Posted on 7/17/2002 12:35:01 AM --  \\n\\n![purple flower by\\ntatosh]([URL]http://www.wincustomize.com[/URL]\\n\\n[Download]  \\-- [Zoom]  \\-- [Visit WinCustomize]\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]  \\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Create and decompress zip archives\\nwith the Chilkat Zip ActiveX control. The control provides easy access to\\nindividual files stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within\\nthe zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual files or files\\nmatching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to any directory, and the control's\\nmemory management allows any size file to be compressed or decompressed in a\\nconstant memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly from\\nmemory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files with wildcarding.\\nThere's even a real-time progress monitor for zip and unzip operations.\\nChilkat supports Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++\\nBuilder, and all languages that use ActiveX controls.\\n\\nin Java  \\n**Anfy Java 2.0**  \\nAnfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop wallpapers, or\\nscreensavers. Within the program's simple interface, you can quickly apply\\nreal-time graphic effects to GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-\\nmapped cube menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom rotators,\\nlens magnification, waving flags, animations, scrolling text, customizable IFS\\nfractals, color changers, light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.\\n\\nin Tools & Editors  \\n**VB-PowerWrap 3.1**  \\nDistribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with VB-PowerWrap. VB-\\nPowerWrap embeds all dependent and non-dependent files into the executable of\\nyour VB program, including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,\\nto create a single clickable application.
