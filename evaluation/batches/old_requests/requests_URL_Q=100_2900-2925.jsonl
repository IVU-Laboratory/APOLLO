Unfortunately, my client Mrs. Stella Olusegun \\nObasanjo died on Saturday October 22nd, 2005. For details of her death \\nvisit:\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n          Before the untimely death of my client, she had through a security \\ncompany here in Nigeria moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was to \\nproceed to Netherlands from Spain where she went just for medial check-up  \\nimmediately after the check-up to complete arrangements and have this money \\nDeposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the \\nfunds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should \\nbe claimed by the depositor (My Client) or her next of kin within 14 working \\ndays, thinking that they are to take the funds just the way some   \\nsecurities companies did to one of our late presidents wife and her family \\n(Mrs. Maryam Abacha)  else the fund will be forfeited to the state, with \\nsuch the husband wouldn\ufffdt like or wish to hear this from the press or any \\none. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund \\nout of the Finance Company, I will be doing the greatest injustice to my \\nlate client and her family. This is why I decided for you to stand in as a \\nnext of kin or her business partner who was supposed to receive the funds \\nfor investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only \\nperson who has access to my client's documents. The Finance firm has just \\nsent a reminder to my client through me, informing her of the maturity of \\nher fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is \\nsubject to negotiations. I need the following information from you. Your \\nfull names,address,telephone and Fax numbers. Also Copy of your \\nIdentification.

Unfortunately, my client Mr Shouwkat Kahlil was one of the passengers that died in the ill-fated plane crash involving a Boeing 727 UTA chartered flight that took off from Cotonou, Republic of Benin and crashed into the Atlantic ocean on Thursday, 25 December 2003. For details of the plane crash,please visit :\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nBefore the untimely death of my client, he had through a security company here in Cotonuo moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was to\\nproceed to Netherlands immediately after the Holiday to complete arrangements and have this money Deposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the funds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should be claimed by the depositor (My Client) or his next of kin within 14 working days, else the fund will be forfeited to the state. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund out of the Finance Company, I will be doing the greatest injustice to my late friend and his family. this is why I decided to you to stand in as a next of kin or his business partner who was supposed to receive the funds for investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only person who has access to my client's documents. The Finance firm has just sent a reminder to my client through me, informing him of the maturity of his fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is subject to negotiations.

I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentage indicated once you have agreed to get this fund transferred \\nthrough your account.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate move of this fund to you arranged, you \\nmust apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating.\\n\\n1.

I am Mr. Michael Dohn , with Banque Internationale De L'Afrique with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited the sum of  US$7.5million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the website; [URL]www.cnn.com[/URL] But, since that year after the death of our client, we have not had anybody that comes for the claims of this money as the next of kin to our client. A situation I have monitored closely with my position in our bank. \\n\\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before and after his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past years now, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now humbly solicit for your assistance in this issue. I wish to present you as the next of kin to this our client so as to claim out this money, before it is remmited into the fedral account where other people may aswell claim it directly without going to this lenght. I have taken every necessary precautionary measures  concerning this issue and arrangement has been concluded by me in achieving this goal, provided you will follow my instructions in the process. I am only waiting for your response to enable me move the funds to your agreed safe account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed also provided you give me your assistance and support.\\n\\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences. \\n\\nThank you in anticipation of your urgent response to my request stating your wish in this deal.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nMr Michael Dohn. \\n+228-917-87-92..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

In my department, I discovered an abandoned consignment worth over sum of US$12Million dollars (Twelve Million US dollars) in file that belongs to our foreign customer,    LATE MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. Below is a website which I will appreciate you going through to read the information.    [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]   Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all effort has proved abortive.   The reason why I am contacting you is based on trust to enable me present you as the next-of-kin to him so this consignment will be released to you for safety and subsequent disbursement.    Nobody has come to our company for claiming of the consignment.    It will be easy to convince the company since I am in possession of the necessary legalised documents that backs-up the consignment and which will present you as the rightful next-of-kin to the deceased customer. I don't want this consignment to go into company,s treasury as unclaimed bill.    The company laws and guidelines stipulates that if such consignment remains unclaimed after seven years, the company will confiscate it.    The request for a foreigner as next-of-kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that late ANDREAS was a foreigner and any indigene cannot stand as next-of-kin to a foreigner.   All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I agree that 25% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of your assistance , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction, another 5% to help the less privilege and to assist the charity organisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 65% will be for me.    Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate release of this consignment, you must apply to the company as the relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your complete information, complete name, postal address, occupation, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the consignment will be release to.    Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the Application you will send to the company to seek the release of the consignment to you. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required Arrangements have been made. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail. My email address i: johnamaneclarke1@aim.com   Or you can send your number for me to call you. Trusting to hear from you immediately for more detailed discussion.    Regards,   John Amane Clarke.
