While SA did a surprisingly accurate job on detecting English language spam, it did not succeed very well on German language spam, which I keep getting increasing amounts of lately. I've got a lousy results with out of the box scores, very few spam is acually cought. What is the strategy with respect to foreign language spam recognition in SA? I've seen extremely few non-english rules. Is there foreign language rule development going on? Has anybody done work on German spam? In any case, I've started spam/nonspam corpi consisting of only German (and Swiss-German, respectively) messages, to be able to help with German rules. Anybody willing to contribute to the corpus feel free to resend/bounce German spam in a sane way to spam@roe.ch . I cannot be bothered to subscribe to SAsightings just for the odd German spam every hundred++ messages.. how about a list for foreign language spam sightings? Has anybody done this before or am I on the edge of duplicating effort here? I've been thinking on this a bit. I think it would be best if there would be general provisions for foreign language rules. In the spirit of the ok_languages option; let users easily enable or disable rules in certain languages. Like a foreign_rules option which could be used to control which foreign rulesets are active. Usually people would want to use checks in all languages which are in the ok_languages list. Is there any development or are there plans along those lines? Are there other people willing to contribute to effective spam filtering rules in German language? Any kind of feedback is welcome, even flames ;) Cheers, Dan --     Daniel Roethlisberger     OpenPGP key id 0x804A06B1 (1024/4096 DSA/ElGamal)    144D 6A5E 0C88 E5D7 0775 FCFD 3974 0E98 804A 06B1    >> privacy through technology, not legislation << ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

Thanks for your suggestions.\\n\\nWell, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU\\nfan.\\n\\nI bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)\\nbut I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.\\nIt has 4 x 51/4\" drive bays and 6 x 3\" drive bays so I should be ok for\\nfuture upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work\\non. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come\\noff, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb\\nscrews). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands\\noff shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3\\ndifferent speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box\\nis big and has loads of room inside.\\nOh... and it looks very cool :-)\\n\\nHowever there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says\\n\\n* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!\\n* ATX Power supply sold separately\\n\\nIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I\\nordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.\\nAlso the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the\\nUSB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from\\nthat show) but I missed that :-)\\n\\nI also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.\\n(thanks Mike)\\n\\nSo now I can code-in-peace...\\n\\nJustin\\n\\n\\n> -----Original Message-----\\n> From: ilug-admin@linux.ie [mailto:ilug-admin@linux.ie]On Behalf Of\\n> Justin MacCarthy\\n> Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 12:56 PM\\n> To: Ilug@Linux.Ie\\n> Subject: [ILUG] PC Cases\\n>\\n>\\n> Hi all, I have a Linux box at home that makes a god awful amount of noise.\\n> Its a Athlon XP 1900+  with a  CoolerMaster fan.
