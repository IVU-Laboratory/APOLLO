Jackson Khumalo\\nJOHANNESBURG-SOUTH AFRICA\\nPrivate email: jackkhumalo@sify.com   \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nATTN: PRESIDENT/\\nCEO,\\n\\n\\nDIRECTOR, DELIVERY/OPERATIONS\\nRE: TRANSFER OF US$25 MILLION\\nFOR INVESTMENT.\\n\\nI am Mr. Jackson khumalo, the Director of Delivery/Operations in a security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa especially top government officials and military leaders in the world. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on \\nBusiness proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. To be explicit and straight to the point, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's \\nVault for safekeeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide\\nto contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his \\nConsignment had accumulated I discovered that our client was the former Late Prime\\n\\nMinister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri,\\n\\n                     PROFILE\\nof the Late Minister of Lebanon: Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri {November 1,\\n1944  February 14, 2005} married to Nazek Audi  Hariri, was a Lebanese\\nself  made billionaire and business tycoon, and was former \\nPrime Minister of Lebanon {1992  1998 and 2000  2004} before his late\\nresignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg\\nof C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George\\nHotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to\\n\\n{[URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL]}.\\n\\nAfter in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or \\nAids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of\\ncuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box that\\nwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained a\\nconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to\\nabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have been\\nnursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the\\nforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his\\ncountry while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my conviction\\nthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our\\nclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this\\nmoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I \\nFound that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).\\n\\nFinally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist\\nme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for\\nimmediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously be\\nentitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply\\nconfirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I \\nWill immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and\\ntransfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute\\nconfidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail\\n\\n(jackkhumalo@sify.com)\\n\\nI await your most prompt\\nresponse.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr. Jackson khumalo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Dear Friend,  I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b  roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about. [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] It is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my lawyer who is base in London Uk to finalize this transaction with you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \u7423sqla}IA{iql\u741aGkester_jone_s@yahoo.com.hk Sir/Madam, I am kester jones  An Accountant with Unity Trust Bank Plc London UK. I got contact from British Chamber of Commerce  Industries Foreign Trade Department, On the cost of my research for a Foreign partner who can assist me for urgent and  confidential business Relationship.   On January 7, 1996, An America Oil consultant/contractor with the submit oil company London UK, Engr. Kim Changho made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at ?5,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) in my Bank upon maturity. I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from one of their staff in The submit oil company that Engr. Kim Changho is among the passengers that perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our customer.. On further investigation, i found out that he died without making a  WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Kim Changho did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of ?5,000,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the British law, at the expiration of (10)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund Consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to late Engr. Kim Changho, So that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an  Attorney for the Drafting and Notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour for the transfer. Any Bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 55%  for me and 40% for you, While we keep 5% for  local and international expenses we might incure in the cost of this transaction, Take Note: There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Accountant guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately, upon your response,i shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

And part of our share of 87% would be invested in your country in any profitable business proposed by you. While a large part of our share will also be used to help charity organizations.\\n\\nWe have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u0092t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

Bill made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500,000.00(TEN Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill and har husband and their only son. died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:[URL]http://www.marsearthconnection.com[/URL]\\nOn further investigation, I found out that she died without making a  WILL and attempts to trace har next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to AFRICAN law, at the expiration of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill so that the fruit of this old woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will  be set aside for expenses incured during the business . There is no risk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your responses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank\\naccount(:1) The beneficiary's name(.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\nAwaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:johnduf1@post.cz and johnduf2320021@mail2world.com or call\\nme on my private telephone number: +221-5124859\\n\\nThanks and God bless,\\n\\nMr JOHN DUF\\nMANAGER:\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. \\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON 31ST OCTOBER 1999 IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN ORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEEP THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF AND PARTNERS TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS  USD7.2M(SEVEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE INFORMATION THROUGH THE BURKINA FASO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON FOREIGN BUSINESS RELATIONS HERE IN BURKINA FASO. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST US AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATED BANK ACCOUNT. I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR ME. PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP \"TOP SECRET\" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU. I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU. PLEASE INDICATE YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER WHEN REPLYING THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL PREFERABLY THROUGH MY ONLY CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL ADDRESS:(jeff_murd@yahoo.fr) OR CALL ME ON MY ABOVE DIRECT TELEPHONE NUMBER 0022678037693. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED, PLEASE ALSO INDICATE SO THAT IT WILL ENABLE ME TO CONTACT ANOTHER FOREIGN PARTNER WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO CARRY OUT THIS DEAL.A SWIFT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL WILL BE APPRECIATED.THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVE YOUR EMAIL.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Allstate Trust Bank\\n16\\\\17, Oyin Jolayemi Street,\\nVictoria Island Lagos \\nWebsite: [URL]http://www.allstatesbanking.com[/URL]\\n\\nDear Sir, \\n\\nI hope this will not meet you as a surprise, as I know that I have not \\n\\nheard any previous corressponding with you, but have taken interest in \\n\\nyou, as a result of my choice of investment. I am Okpara Addey, \\n\\nManaging Director, Corporate Audit ,Allstate Trust Bank, Nigeria. This \\n\\nis an urgent and very confidential business proposition. I am seeking \\n\\nyour assistance here to enable me transfer and  invest the sum of $24M \\n\\nin LANDED PROPERTIES there in  your country. The source of these funds \\n\\nis as follows:\\n\\nOn June 6, 2002,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian \\n\\nInstitute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Steve Warren, made a numbered \\n\\ntime(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at \\n\\nUS$24,000,000.00,(Twenty-Four Million Dollars) in my branch. \\n\\nUpon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \\n\\nbut got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we \\n\\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian Institute of \\n\\nMining and Metallurgy, that Mr.Steve Warren died from an automobile \\n\\naccident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without \\n\\nmaking a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. \\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Steve \\n\\nWarren did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official \\n\\ndocuments, including his Bank Deposit documents in my Bank. This sum of \\n\\nUS$24,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. \\n\\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. \\n\\nAccording to the Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, \\n\\nthe money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody \\n\\napplies to claim the fund. \\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that, since Mr.Steve Warren is a \\n\\nForeigner, I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of \\n\\nthe money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you \\n\\nbecause I as a public servant, I cannot operate a foreign account, and \\n\\nmoreso, my choice of investment, which is one of the reasons why I \\n\\nwould want you to assist me, as I will need your assistance to invest \\n\\nthese funds in the Real Estate  business, to which which any PROFIT \\n\\nRETURN will be shared under an agreed percentage between the both of \\n\\nus, outside the normal percentage to be agreed on for your assistance.\\n\\nI want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to \\n\\nclaim them. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your \\n\\nfull names and address, as well as phone and fax numbers,so that all  \\n\\nthe neccessary document can be  prepared , which will put you in place \\n\\nas the beneficiary of the funds.\\n\\nThe money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me \\n\\nand 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done in \\n\\naccordance to the law of the land and this guarantees the successful \\n\\nexecution of this transaction. \\n\\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address \\n\\nat: amokpara007@yahoo.co.uk, and upon your response,I shall provide \\n\\nyou with more details and relevant documents that will help you \\n\\nunderstand the transaction. \\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this \\n\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\n\\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in Real Estate  within your \\n\\ncountry. This is the major reason why I have contacted you.\\n\\nDue to the nature and confidentiality in this Transaction, it should be \\n\\naccorded all the neccesary confidentiality required, as my job will be \\n\\nat stake in the event of any eventuality.   I hope that this will meet \\n\\nyou in a good state of mind.\\n\\nI will pause for now, as I await your urgent response\\n\\nRegards.\\n\\nOkpara Addey\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Foreword\\n\\nAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in \"Ghetto America,\" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the \"Black Generation X\". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of \"Generation X\". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed \"Baby Boomers\", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled \"Generation X\", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: \\n \\n \"We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called \"Xer's\" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.\"\\n\"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.\" \\n\\nThis definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these \"similarities\" speak primarily to only \"white\" issues and concerns. For instance, \"they\" say \"we\" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America \"we\" could only depend on one our mothers! \"They\" also say, \" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,\" and \" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever.\" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all \"we\" have time for. \\nI have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the \"Black\" from \"Generation X\" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.\\nThere are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. \"White America\" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled \"Ethnic Notions.\" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching \"Roger & Me,\" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex\\n posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.\\nRegarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.\\n Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. \\nWhat originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with \"Huxtable?like\" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or \"working class\" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the \"Huxtable?like\" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. \\nThe majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our \"dirty laundry\". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. \\nI recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. \\nThe purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that \"black male and female generation X\" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)\\nRegarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.\\nIn my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. \\nThinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our \"male rapper\" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. \"The Big Tymers\", a popular rap duo, have a song called \"I'm Still Fly\", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (\"Fly\" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:\\n\\n\"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci\\nSuit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's\\nspent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.\"\\n\\nWorse yet, in the song \"Grinding\", the popular duo \"Eclipse\" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term \"grinding\" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are \"grindingyou know what I keep in the lining\" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and\\n\\n\"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man\\nI bake them cakes as fast as I can\\nand you can tell cause of how my bread stack up\\nand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup\"\\n\\nIn this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term \"cake\" or sometimes \"pie\") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. \\nThe negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al\\n luded too. \\nI have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of \"us\" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. \\nAdditionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being \"African?Americans\", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as \"Black\", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as \"Niggas,\" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with \"Nigger\". The term \"nigga\" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term \"My Nigga\") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as \"Ghetto\", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the\\n  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. \\nMy commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.\\nIn the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by \"White America\". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno\\n wledging that this absence is by design. \\nThere are other \"core\" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not \"thugged out\". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the \"thug,\" and \"drug dealer\" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. \\nThese issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that \"confused mentality\" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American \"ghetto\" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that \"ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into \"Black America\".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that \"backward thinking\" is the main \\n cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.\\n*************************************************************\\n To read More go to [URL]www.blackrealitypublishing.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\\nwith \"unsubscribe freebsd-ports\" in the body of the message\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

This is by virtue of its nature\\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. \\nThough I know that a transaction of this magnitude\\nwill make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am\\nassuring you that all will be well at the end of the\\nday. \\n\\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\\ndecided it is best using the email. \\n\\nLet me start by first introducing myself properly to\\nyou. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the\\nMinistry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man\\ntender board appointed by the Government of the\\nFederal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to\\nindividuals and companies and to approve such contract\\npayments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The\\nduties of the committee also include evaluation,\\nvetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign\\nand local contractors in the ministry.\\n\\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \\n\\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\\nrural electrification projects. \\n\\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\\nintention that the committee will share the excess\\nwhen the payments are approved. \\n\\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\\nand contractors concerned which executed the\\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\\nourselves.\\n\\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\\nhandicapped in this circumstances as the civil service\\ncode of conduct, does not allow us to operate\\noff-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole\\ntransaction is highly needed . \\n\\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \\n\\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not\\nwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.\\n\\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\\ncases of business associates running away with funds\\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\\nbe based completely on the following: \\n\\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\\ndiligence. \\n\\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \\n\\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \\n\\n(d).
