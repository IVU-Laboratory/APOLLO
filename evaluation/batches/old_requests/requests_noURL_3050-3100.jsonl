Dear Nicety, As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking  up your computer I'm afraid your \"SOL\" as finding a true solution.   There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts  resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many  programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working  in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a  regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened  and closed several different applications. Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional, wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at  [URL]http://www.unix-vs-nt.org[/URL]  What was true back then is  even truer today.  Every current \"worm\" you are hearing about  on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.   So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change  the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of  weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running  I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.  I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and  the price is right -- free.

Comments on Site #140:  [URL]http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com[/URL] Margarete MDegaston@aol.com ~~~~ I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate  sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well  presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been  a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,  preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a  relationship to it. What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something  related to the url  \"prosperouswomen\" to come up, as this  \"word\" was what caught my attention and caused me to  click in the first place. I feel the book page should be a tool for the \"PW\" page and  not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the  book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page. (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.) With these: Find out how you can receive the free book. Email us at directions4U@aol.com         and For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing  write to us at directions4U@aol.com I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than  copy and paste. Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.  (and I have ordered the book!) ~~~~ I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.   Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics  or where we were headed. ~~~~ Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book. Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish  between the links and that which is not. I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also  linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that  link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site. If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a  request message to an aol email address you would get more  requests, and also might be able to automate this process. ~~~~ I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point. It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.   If only other sites we so simplistic! ~~~~ With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact  on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences  in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box  with \"Life Changeing Insight\" needs the 'e' taken out of  'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended  to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100  year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of  using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where  or how or by whom it was discovered. The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that  would make the site more effective (on getting people to request  the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in  what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to  order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form  for this just about anywhere. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

Co-investment Program =22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22 More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa\u00e7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.  Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade. Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local resources (labor, some equipment, etc.) For more information: Mini-plants in mobile containers By Steven P.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        fork ,\\n\\nFrom;Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,\\n         Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\nMy name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la\\n st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc\\n ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.David Kargbou and family. \\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! !!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! = !!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! = INVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! I found this on a bulletin board and = decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through = newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to = this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with = only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must = be a scam\", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. = Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address = stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the = bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 = newsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after = thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about = trying it. I figured: \"what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and = $6.00, right?\" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... = Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I = figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my = first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had = made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 = and it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a = total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's = certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the = lottery!!(This is not me but i am\u00a0also making alot of = money)\u00a0Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, = WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so = you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you = that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making = more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! = Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or = download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes = in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus = postage) IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; = it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of = the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive = extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow = these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 = days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and = integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully = adhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order = business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's = a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many = large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. = However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the = income, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included = in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get = 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of = paper \"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.\" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills = and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not = be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one = paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 = sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, = your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating = a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate = service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little = skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I = checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they = confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following = addresses: #1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, = KY.40391 #2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 #3) = Brian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 #4) A. Guy , = 6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 #5) Wes Armstrong, 157 = Butternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 #6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box = 1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the = list that you see above, move the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes = #1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on = the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep = this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your = amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to = 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the = more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. = This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 = Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these = steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, = and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful = because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their = carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of = integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many = others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to = retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard = copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are = truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 = bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post = is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be = reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar = each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your = name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars = in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the = first six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the = list and you're in business! -----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO = POST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- Step 1) You do not need to re-type = this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the = beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this = document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the = entire letter into the computer's memory. Step 2) Open a blank = 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From = the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter = into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step = 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your = postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back = to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching = for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, = discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this = article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and = selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will = be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of = postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're = done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to = do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang = of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! = **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU = WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** that's it! = You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You = may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of = mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent = a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE = ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** Now, each of the 5 persons who = just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at = #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another = $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at = #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, = those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at = #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! = OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM = 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, = that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this = message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per = 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original = investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the = list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out = another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. = And start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even = $60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! The thing to remember is: do you = realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the = Internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! = So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... = People have said, \"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you = the money?\" So what! What are the chances of that happening when there = are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the = Internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? = Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands = of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY = and this will really work.

On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.\\n\\nIf interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.\\n\\nThe informations will be as follows.......\\n\\nBank Name.........\\nBank Address........\\nA/C Name.............\\nA/C Number..............\\nSwift Code No..............\\nRouting Number................\\n\\nI want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly.

I pray that this email reaches you \\nin the best of health.\\n\\nI am Mr Denguele djaratigui, the manager of bill and  exchange at the \\nforeign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we \\ndiscoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred \\nthousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next \\nof  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\n  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  \\nindicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at \\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this \\nbusiness  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or \\nrelation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank \\ntreasury as   unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained \\nunclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by\\nthe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as \\nnext of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you \\nas  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.\\n\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  \\nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  \\nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  \\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should \\ncontact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully.\\n\\nMr Denguele djaratigui,\\n\\nN/B: CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL OR WRITE EMAIL,\\nE-MAIL: dengue_djara_1544@yahoo.fr\\nTEL: +226-76-45-08-13.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Live Mail Beta !

I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. \\nThe latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:[URL]http://www.newswatchngr.com[/URL]] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; [URL]http://www.thisdayonline.com[/URL], click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.\\nOn this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.\\nAnd thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. \\nMy problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.\\nI shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.\\nIn acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.\\nThanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation. I am looking forward for a healthy business relationship with you  and my entire household. \\n\\nHoping to hear from you.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nHajia Maryam Abacha.\\n\\nCall me on My Telephone Number 234-80-33357110\\n\\nplease for security reasons reply through to the fax number FAX 234-1-7590893 instead of the email as it is general to all the family member.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some\\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future\\nmay be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to\\nremain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. \"Every major\\nindustry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar\\ntransformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the\\nmid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert\\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.\\nChristopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all the people\\nthat are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving\\ncarriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few\\nmillions.\" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the\\nlink at the end of this newsletter._\\n\\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)\\nhas only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As\\nInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this\\ncompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.\\nThis could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our\\nHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**\\n\\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.\\nA similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),\\nshare price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over\\n$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously\\nhad a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267\\nmillion.\\n\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for\\npotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a\\nfew months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an\\nincrease of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and\\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to\\noffer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building\\na communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will\\nexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market\\nwill return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,\\nIndia, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_\\n\\n\\n\\n**Particulars**\\n\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth\\nrecommendation list for the following reasons:\\n\\n1\\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and\\nmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to\\nsmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.
