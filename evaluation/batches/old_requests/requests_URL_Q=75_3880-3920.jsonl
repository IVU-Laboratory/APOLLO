[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Adams, I am Barrister John Solomon a legal Solicitor and I was the Personal Attorneyand legal adviser to Mr.Joshua Adams, a national of your country,who used to work with Mobil oil Company here in Togo. On the 7th of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along imo Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives,this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail,hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get impounded by the security company were my client deposited this consignment(two trunkboxes). Particularly,the security company where the deceased had deposited this consignment valued at about eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($U.S8.5million) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the consignment confiscated/impounded within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over two years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this consignment valued at eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars($U.S8.5million)can be claimed by you and then you and i can share the money. Note that this consignment was recorded as family treasures belonging to my late client and only you and i knows the content of the two boxes with the security company. I will require your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangementthat will protect you from any breach of the law. Contact me via my private email (barrister_johnsolomon@yahoo.co.uk) to enable us discuss further.

Hope all is well. Please be informed that I have decided to contact you for a fund transfer transaction worth the sum of US$22,300,000.00 into your reliable bank account as the sole NEXT-OF-KIN to the foreign deceased customer of our bank (an International Billionaire French Businessman) who was killed with his entire family by PLANE-CRASH in Central England atmost 3 years ago. Since his death occured, no body have show up as his next of kin for the claim because the account is untraceable. Upon the investigation I carried out from his records, I found out that his foreign business consultant who would have trace the account died earlier before the deceased. Therefore, this is a confidential and sealed deal. For the success of this transaction, you should apply and act as the only existing NEXT-OF-KIN to the deceased which our bank will replace the deceased account information through proper documentation in position of your own account. This transaction is risk-free, it will never harm your good reputation in your society because no one can trace the account, and on the instant of the transfer of the fund into your account, the chapter of this transaction will be closed entirely. Note that in a business of this nature, the bank dont want to know your difference between the deceased country, religion or believe because our bank inheritance law is against that. So, it is a preference for us achieve this success without any problem.Please note down that once the fund get transferred into your account, you will take 39% of the total sum while the rest will be for me as I will arrange myself down to your country to take my share.

Though, this medium (Internet) has been \\ngreatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still \\nremains the fastest medium of communication. However, this \\ncorrespondence is  unofficial and private, and it should be treated as \\nsuch. \\n\\nAt first I will like to assure you that this transaction is \\n100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT \\nMONEY FROM OUR BANK\\nHERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF \\nCLEANORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program \\nleader. Until his death, The Late Prime  Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, \\nhas a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the \\nworld, as a matter of fact he has the sum of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN \\nHUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS  STERLINGS) in his account here \\nin London which he deposited as a family valuables.\\n\\n The families do \\nnot  know about this deposit. I was on a routine  inspection that I \\ndiscovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX \\nMILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on \\nfurther discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account \\nholder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. \\nThe bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the  former \\noperator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody \\nwill come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim \\nthis\\nmoney with legal claims to the account Holder, \\n \\nI need your full \\ncooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary \\ninformation needed in order to claim this money. Hoping in God that you \\nwill never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine  Hariri \\n(November 1, 1944- February 14, 2005), married to  Nazek Audi Hariri, \\nwas a Lebanese self-made billionaire \\nand business tycoon, and was five \\ntimes Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his \\nlast  resignation from office on October 20,2004. The late Rafik \\nHariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent  to around \\n300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove  past the Saint \\nGeorge Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for  more information please log \\non to ([URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL]\\n\\nI WANT TOTRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A \\nSAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER  WHOM I CAN \\nTRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE \\nDON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE\\nBUSINESS.

I am contacting you concerning a customer  \\nand an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  \\nfact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  \\nthe contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  \\nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  \\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  \\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  \\ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  \\nto engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  \\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  \\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  \\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  \\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  \\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  \\nespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  \\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  \\nand however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  \\nprime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  \\nby assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  \\nmanagers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  \\nmoney around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  \\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  \\nstood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  \\nmargin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  \\nguaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  \\nmoney be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  \\nrequiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  \\nfunds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  \\nour bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  \\nin order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  \\n9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  \\ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  \\nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  \\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  \\nincidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  \\nmainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  \\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  \\ndeposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  \\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  \\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  \\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  \\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  \\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  \\ndeposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  \\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  \\nwe had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  \\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  \\nthat particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  \\nwas concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  \\nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  \\nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  \\nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  \\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  \\nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  \\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  \\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  \\nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  \\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  \\nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  \\nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  \\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  \\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  \\nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  \\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  \\nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  \\naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  \\nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  \\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  \\nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  \\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  \\ncare, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have  \\npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  \\ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate, this  \\ninvestigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  \\ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  \\nget to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  \\nin my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  \\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  \\nestate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  \\ndeceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  \\nsupervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  \\nof the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  \\nhave considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  \\nor identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  \\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  \\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  \\nthe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  \\nclaim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  \\nprobably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  \\nmoney entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  \\nout of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  \\nThis will not happen if I have my way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  \\nbut I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  \\nbanking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  \\naberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  \\nhuge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  \\nportfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  \\ndirection of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  \\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  \\none unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  \\nthis deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  \\ntransaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  \\nto the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  \\njust customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  \\nidea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  \\nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  \\nforward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  \\nof the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  \\nfamily but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  \\nI am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  \\nto release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  \\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  \\nhalf and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  \\nkin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  \\nproceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  \\nme, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  \\nin claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  \\nforeigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  \\nclaim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  \\nfew days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  \\nfile relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  \\nthe finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  \\nwith these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  \\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  \\nholder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  \\nthe money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  \\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  \\nin this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  \\nyou do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  \\nto you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  \\nnot destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  \\nmay not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  \\ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  \\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  \\nmay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  \\ndictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  \\nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  \\nunderstand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  \\nto face with my destiny.\\n\\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  \\nchance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  \\nmove on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  \\nthis is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  \\nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  \\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  \\nrefusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  \\nknows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  \\ninto the center of relevance in my life, let\u0092s share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  \\nspecifically, through this email account (qin2wang2000@yahoo.com.cn),  \\nif you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards  \\na conclusion.

So YOUR web site can be FOUND and SEEN For Twelve Months! Guaranteed!   (See our testimonials) Think about it! Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site.  Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!  A Shocking Fact! Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business. Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen. You have to be put there! What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said: \"You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!\" You need a professional company to do it! Your Money Back Guarantee!  If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed! There is nothing to lose! Some testimonials of those that have used  Regal Telecom \"This service is my secret weapon.

I have received enquires from Austria, Hawaii, Spain and many different parts of Britain for my international real estate business. This is directly due to this service. I definitely recommend it!  Worth every penny!\" keyhomes.net \"We run a Cancer Clinic and it is essential that our web site is submitted to as many search engines as possible. We are looking forward to having the capability to do online video conferencing and online diagnosis with our patients from many parts of the world. It is a real advantage to have the capabilities that  Regal Telecom offers.\" Mari Posas Cancer Clinic. \"We never received a single inquiry until we used Regal Telecom\" noniuk.co.uk To submit your web site all we need is your web site and  e-mail address. We will do the rest! Once we have submitted your web site you will receive a dramatic response by e-mail from search engines around the world confirming that you are listed on them.  This will happen every month for the next year! To Book our Service Simply PRESS this    BOOK NOW! Button and we can begin submitting your web site to the worlds search engines today! Then be ready for the response! Within 24 hours your web site will begin to be submitted to over 350 search engines world wide and every month  thereafter for the next year. The results will astound you! Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below! This is to YOUR Advantage! Web Site Facts Remember \"The Yellow Pages\" Rule!   A search engine is like an enormous \"yellow pages\" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the \"Yellow pages\" in the world. What does it take to be seen on the  Search Engines? Appreciate the Three Golden Rules q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom!  q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on). q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines!  Use the right ones and you go up. Get it wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines.  Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased.  It is essential to be on them! Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need.   This can make the difference between new customers  FINDING your web site or NOT!

This is to YOUR  Advantage! \u00a0 \u00a0 Web Site  Facts Remember \"The Yellow  Pages\" Rule!\u00a0 \u00a0A  search engine is like an enormous \"yellow pages\" with thousands of companies  advertising the same product.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you are near the front of the  listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.\u00a0  Unlike a literal yellow pages there  is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the \"Yellow pages\"  in the world. \u00a0 What does it take to be  seen on the  Search  Engines? \u00a0 Appreciate the Three Golden Rules q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random  they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the  top, those that do not are buried at the  bottom!\u00a0 q Your web site must be submitted to the search  engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a  Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless  you  get another ticket and get back on). q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles  employed when submitting your site to the search  engines!\u00a0 Use the right ones  and you go up. Get it  wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large  search engines.  Wrong!\u00a0The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get  buried.\u00a0 Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the  listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them. \u00a0Also  many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally  submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. \u00a0 It is  essential to be on them! \u00a0 Having  Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to  worlds search engines will give YOU  the Advantage\u00a0you need.\u00a0 \u00a0This can make the

Use the right ones and you go up. Get it wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines.  Wrong!

Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased.  It is essential to be on them!

In an account that belongs to this our foreign customer who died \\nalong with his wife and and children in the plane crash.Since we got \\ninformation about his death,\\nwe have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money \\nbecause\\nwe cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but \\nunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died \\nalongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It \\nis therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this usiness\\n\\nproposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to \\nthe deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming \\nfor it because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as \\nunclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such \\nmoney remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into \\nthe bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this \\ntransaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,I agree that 30% of \\nthis money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the \\nbusiness and 60% would be for me ,\\n\\nAfter which I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \\nfund to you as I have arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving \\naccount details where\\nthe money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy \\ncommunication.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of \\nthe application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance \\nmanager,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to \\nyour notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all \\nrequired arrangement have been made for the transfer and more so all the \\ndocuments backing this claim will be supplied to you after you might have \\napplied.Please I would like you you keep this transaction confidential and \\nas a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a senior Bank \\nofficial.Trusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nMr. kaburo  musa\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWindows Live Messenger sur i-mode : dialoguez avec vos amis depuis votre \\nmobile comme sur PC !

KHAN the auditor and head of computing department of a bank here in london,UnitedKingdom.There is an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2000, nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing. In order to transfer out fifteen-million pounds sterling) from our bank here have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.\\n\\nHOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT \\n\\nThe owner of this account was Mr. John Hughes who was a foreigner and the manager of Petro chemical service here in London, a chemical engineer by profession and he died since 1997.And then, since 2001, nobody knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (15,000,000.00) pounds sterling.I want to transfer this money into a safe foreign account abroad but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to any local bank here in london, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is pounds sterling?s and the former owner of the account is John Hughes and he was a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know our selves before neither have we let, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. \\n\\nI believe in God that you will never let me down in this investment.

The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, Commissioned and paid for about\u00a0 three years (3) ago by a foreign\u00a0 contractor.This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Central Bank Of Nigeria Apex Bank. We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and that is where you Come in. It is important to inform you that as civil servants, we are Forbidden to operate a foreign account; that is why we require your\u00a0 assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 65% for us, 30% for you and 5% for local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). If you find this\u00a0 proposal acceptable,we shall require the following documents:(1) Your banker name and address (2) Your private telephone and fax numbers ? for confidentiality and easy communication.(c) Your full name and address.Alternatively we will furnish you with an application form which you will file and apply directly to the Central Bank of Nigeria, where this money was deposited, along with a breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we require of you. The business will take us\u00a0 (14) working days to accomplish.\u00a0Await your urgent response.Yours SincerelyRev.

My\\nlate father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich\\nfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the\\nruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his\\nalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition\\nparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to South\\nAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars\\n($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he\\nknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was\\ndeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much\\ndumourage from the security firm.\\nThis money was earmarked for the purchase of new\\nmachinery and chemicals for the farms and the\\nestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.\\nThis land problem arose when President R. MUGABE\\nintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the\\nWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently\\ncondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the\\ngovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mob\\nactions. I and my family who are currently staying in South\\nAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decided\\nto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the\\nTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher\\ntransfer of the money to a foreign country where we\\ncan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of\\nclaiming/investing this amount of money in South\\nAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience in\\nfuture since both countries have the same political\\nhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does\\nnot allow such investment hence I am seeking for\\nan asylum or refugee.\\nI must let you know that this business is 100% risk\\nfree and the nature of your business does not\\nnecessary matter.
