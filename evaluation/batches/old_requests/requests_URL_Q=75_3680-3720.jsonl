Though I know that a transaction of this\\nmagnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring\\nyou that all will be well at the end of the day. There is no doubt that\\ntrust conceptually is a conundrum which leadsitself to deferring\\ninterpretation, we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this\\ntransaction.\\n\\nI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department\\nof BANK OF AFRICA(BOA). I came to know you in my private search for a\\nreliable and reputable person to handle this Confidential Transaction,\\nwhich involves thetransfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account\\nrequiring maximum confidence.\\n\\nI am writing to you, following the impressive information received about\\nyou from the chambers of commerce. I believed that you are capable and\\nreliable to champion this business opportunity. In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of $30m US dollars (Thirty million US\\ndollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who\\ndied along with his entire family On August 23, 2000 through Gulf Air\\nFlight 72 with Airbus A320 crashed off, killing all 143 people on board\\nand you can view the site for more\\ndetails:[URL]http://www-tech.mit.edu[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it\\nunless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased\\nas indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make\\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nBank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\\nexpenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me and my\\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application.

So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be\\nthe onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of\\nthe countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in\\nNigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for\\nsecurityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ;\\nfortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to\\nairship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery\\nwe willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office,\\nbut for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are\\nunable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you.\\nHere inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means\\nin whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this\\ndecision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of\\nthe totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in\\ncourse ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family. We wish to invest this fund in\\nyourcountry ,this transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded all\\nnecessaryarrangments before contacting you.\\n\\n\\nWe expect your favourable response, indicate your private Telephone and\\nFax numbersfor easy\\ncomunication.

Our Bank is a \\nfinancial institution specialising in private banking to individual customers who likes confidentiality in their financial dealings.I have intrest of investing in your company as such i would like to make contact with you for assistance.\\nOn January 13,1987 an Indian-American mining consultant with the \\nPetrogas Gas Systems BV Environmental Systems, Mr. Dixit Shanti made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty Four calendar months, valued at \\nUS$49,500,000.00 (Forty Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in the Bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie \\nflight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he \\ndied intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his \\nnext-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see\\n[URL]http://www.geocities.com[/URL]\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit \\nShanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents with\\nus, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\\nUS$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or\\noffice including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the\\nservices of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and\\ncourt affidavits which will put you in good standing as the \\nnext-of-kin.\\nA bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later \\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the \\nratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.\\nBe informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to \\nthis project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my \\nposition as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execution \\nof this transaction. If you are interested, please\\nrevert back to me.\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capable and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar\\nThanks and regards.\\nMr. Usman Ramat Shehu\\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \\n[URL]www.freeserve.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.\\n \\nSince we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.\\n \\nthe bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nIn subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.\\nAs soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.\\nTo make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.\\n \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer. \\n \\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nHoping to hear from you immediately.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}
