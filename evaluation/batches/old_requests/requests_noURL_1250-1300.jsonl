There's\\nonly two answers and one of them is wrong.\\n\\n  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to\\n     have a different level of protection dictated\\n     by whoever's offended at the time.\\n  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.\\n     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by \\n     any reasonable person. \\n\\nHate speech is mislabeled.  It's really \"threat\".  I think\\nthey let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage\\nin being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and\\nmoney through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY\\ndon't like.  \\n\\n\\nGreg\\n\\n\\n\\n> _________________________________________________________________\\n> Join the world?s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.\\n> [URL]http://www.hotmail.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for years; and FreeBSD has kqueue. More details about these are at [URL]http://www.citi.umich.edu[/URL] None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O. POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too. It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like \"Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,\" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut. Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors. In detail, he wrote: > Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally > catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for > nontrivial apps? No way! Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra performance. > OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely > ghetto, but at least they are trying.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice. They might be even older than that. Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > Bottom line is the \"do stuff when something happens\" model turned > out to be right, and the UNIX \"look for something to do and keep > looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look\" > is not really working so great anymore. Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with a \"signal\", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a \"signal\" causes the immediate execution of a \"signal handler\" in a process.  By contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process polls them. I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards. Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo(). --         Kragen Sitaker      Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet. I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need. I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course). But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks. In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal. But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you. [URL]http://forums.gentoo.org[/URL] Specifically quote: If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.     * Boot off the install CD     * modprobe serial     * setserial (if needed)     * create mount point for other distribution     * mount other distribution     * chroot'd to other distribution     * su - to regular user     * ran wvdial     * switch consoles and install as normal And yes I do give better technical support to people who use distros I like. I'm only laughing on the outside  My smile is just skin deep  If you could see inside I'm really crying  You might join me for a weep. <> --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

IMHO, that is exactly the case that the trust system is > supposed to sort out. People who incorrectly submit non-spam bulk mail to > razor. Let's take a look at an example here. Someone on this list signed razor-users@fsckit.net up to a ZDNet mailing list that doesn't confirm subscriptions in a piss-poor attempt to mailbomb me. I report all of these mailings to Razor because, guess what, for me this is spam. This and a hundred more traditional spam emails to automated spamtrap addresses get  reported by me daily. I probably have a decent TES value because of all of this. Now lets say someone else who is also reporting a fair amount of your typical proxy/relayed spam has been reporting these and has built up a decent TES rating because of it. However they subscribed to that same ZDNet list and enjoy getting the mail from it except that they don't like seeing  it tagged as spam by Razor. So they razor-revoke it.  Who loses in this case? Why? Neither party is inaccurate in their actions IMO. But someone's standing is going to get hurt because of it.

Also, application browser bugs allow you\\nto target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,\\nor the mailing lists they frequent. It is a \"one button\" push attack, and\\nusing anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.\\n\\nThis vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia\\nFlash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever\\nShockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,\\nnews postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing\\nweb-browsing functionality.\\n\\nTechnical Description:\\nThe data header is roughly made out to:\\n\\n[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too\\nshort)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count\\n(malformed)][Data]\\n\\nBy creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the\\ndecoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function\\npointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as\\nsoon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes\\ncontrol flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back\\nfrom the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a\\n\"call dword ptr [esp+N]\", where N is the number of bytes from the stack\\npointer. These \"jump points\" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By\\ncreating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can\\nexamine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with\\nyour exploitation.\\n\\nThis is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been\\nfound in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we\\nended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.\\n\\nProtection:\\nRetina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of\\nFlash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their\\nsystems.\\n\\nVendor Status:\\nMacromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:\\n[URL]http://www.macromedia.com[/URL]\\nPSB02%2D09%20%2D%20Macromedia%20Flash%20Malformed%20Header%20Vulnerability%2\\n0Issue&Cache=False\\n\\nDiscovery: Drew Copley\\nExploitation: Riley Hassell\\n\\nGreetings: Hacktivismo!, Centra Spike\\n\\nCopyright (c) 1998-2002 eEye Digital Security\\nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this alert\\nelectronically.

Well, when studying engineering the rule of thumb was that infinity was 10 times bigger then the most you could expect to use. Therefore I believe in infinite stack. But I do not feel I am a compiler risk either. So where does this leave me? - Matthew __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages (like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches to break out of.  But, in general, goto's make a mess of code. > Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto  > or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of  > programming syntax > to make sure people use loops or recursion? > <>  Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler. > Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.  For > example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any > advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?  I don't care, to be honest.
