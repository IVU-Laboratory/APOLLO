I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions.    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.

Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills | itself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else. |  | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. |  | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the | vulnerability, if possible.   |  | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible | disclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was. |  | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible | disclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the | underground, vulnerable. |  | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible. |  | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.   |  | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if | HP retained Snosoft's \"consulting services\".  HP considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the | information. |  | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, | together, add up to a catastrophe. |  | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later, | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. |  | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be | --- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. |  | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. |  | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist. |  | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in | Samba, for example. |  | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. |  | Let's not let that happen. |  |  |  |  | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement: |  | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] | Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program |  |  | Greetings, |  | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. |  | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program: |  | Q. How will it work? | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number | of motivations, including the following: |  |          * Pure love of security research |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure |  | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following | items: |  |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided |          * The potential severity level for the information shared |          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other |            software and hardware potentially affected |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs |          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE |  | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other | entity. |  | Q. Why are you launching this program? | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the | public at large are warned in a timely manner. |  | Q. Who gets the credit? | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or | exploit information. |  | Q. When can I contribute? | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today. |  | To learn more, go to [URL]http://www.idefense.com[/URL] If you have | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please | contact us at contributor@idefense.com. |  | Regards, |  | Sunil James | Technical Analyst | iDEFENSE |  | \"iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively | monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and | hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. | The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline | security professionals and network administrators with timely access to | actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. | iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines | the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new | software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.\" |  | [URL]http://xent.com[/URL] |  --  \"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.\" \t\t\t\t\t               -Hume [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"DEU\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits. Description: The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger race in the dcache of the file system subsystem. This kernel update addresses both of these issues. In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following drivers: stradis rio500 se401 usbvideo apm Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had the capability to expose kernel memory when abused. All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the time of this writing, have any known exploits. We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar Designer, and others for their auditing work.

Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills\\nitself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash\\nfor information about security vulnerabilities in computer software\\nthat are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell\\nanyone else.\\n\\nIf this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a\\nvery serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.\\n\\nAt the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research\\nknown as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security\\nvulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short\\nwhile later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem\\n--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the\\nvulnerability, if possible.  \\n\\nThis method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by\\nCERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible\\ndisclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release\\nany information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released\\na patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\\nvulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\\non features, and often, even after the patches were released, people\\nwouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem\\nwas.\\n\\nThe underground computer criminal community would often discover and\\nexploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible\\ndisclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the\\nunderground, vulnerable.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\\nare much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to\\nreduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,\\nturning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and\\ndetecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less\\nuseful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see\\nsecurity vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so\\nprefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as\\nlong as possible.\\n\\niDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\\nthan either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in\\na marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding\\ndiscoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  \\n\\nNot long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently\\nincluding some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the\\nsecrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\\nvendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to\\nHewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if\\nHP retained Snosoft's \"consulting services\".  HP considered this\\nextortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the\\ninformation.\\n\\nIf this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,\\ntogether, add up to a catastrophe.\\n\\nFirst, secret software vulnerability information will be available to\\nthe highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,\\nI think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\\nsyndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.\\n\\nSecond, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\\nbecome lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be\\n--- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good\\nguys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority\\nof current vulnerabilities are kept secret.\\n\\nI've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\\nvendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's\\nplausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets\\nthem, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the\\npeople who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when\\ncredit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.\\nKnowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site\\nadministrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some\\nnegative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.\\n\\nI think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\\ninformation is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to\\nexecute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that\\nmeans organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who\\nare good at networked theft may not yet exist.\\n\\nThere might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as\\nMicrosoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\\nthan a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in\\nSamba, for example.\\n\\nRight now, people who know how to find security exploits are either\\nmotivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public\\ninterest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or\\npersonally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating\\na marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\\nincrease the availability of that information to the people who can\\nafford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.\\n\\nLet's not let that happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the original iDEFENSE announcement:\\n\\nFrom: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]\\nSent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM\\nSubject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program\\n\\n\\nGreetings,\\n\\niDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\\nContributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance\\nnotification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.\\n\\niDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following\\nprovides answers to some basic questions about the program:\\n\\nQ. How will it work?\\nA. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\\nsecurity research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number\\nof motivations, including the following:\\n\\n         * Pure love of security research\\n         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\\n         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\\n         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\\n\\nThe VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\\nInternet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the\\nwork.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following\\nitems:\\n\\n         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)\\n         * The amount of detail and analysis provided\\n         * The potential severity level for the information shared\\n         * The types of applications, operating systems, and other\\n           software and hardware potentially affected\\n         * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\\n         * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE\\n\\nQ. Who should contribute to the VCP?\\nA. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other\\nentity.\\n\\nQ. Why are you launching this program?\\nA. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions\\nto some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More\\noften, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the\\noriginal contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is\\ncompensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the\\npublic at large are warned in a timely manner.\\n\\nQ. Who gets the credit?\\nA. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or\\nexploit information.\\n\\nQ. When can I contribute?\\nThe VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.\\n\\nTo learn more, go to [URL]http://www.idefense.com[/URL] If you have\\nquestions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please\\ncontact us at contributor@idefense.com.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nSunil James\\nTechnical Analyst\\niDEFENSE\\n\\n\"iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively\\nmonitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and\\nhacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.\\nThe iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline\\nsecurity professionals and network administrators with timely access to\\nactionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.\\niDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines\\nthe behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new\\nsoftware/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and\\noutput) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly\\ndesigned systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for\\nCSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break\\nwith exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)\\nbecause of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export\\nrules at the time.\\n\\nEven more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing\\nplayer break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They\\nrapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm\\nwith an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks\\nmight have further reduced the strength).
