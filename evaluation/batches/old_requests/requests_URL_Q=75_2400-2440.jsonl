He \\nassured me of your capability and releability to champion this\\nbusiness opportunity.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a \\nplane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless\\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here \\nstipulates that if such money\\nremained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the \\nbank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in \\nthis business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in \\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location\\nwherein the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \\nmore explanations.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR YUSUF SAMI.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Good day, \\n\\nThis email message requires your utmost confidentiality. \\n\\nIt is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. \\n\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. \\n\\nMy Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her!\\n e \\n(Holland) to seek for political asylum. \\n\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. \\n\\nSince President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. \\n\\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. \\n\\nYour role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. \\n\\nAfter the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \\n\\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. \\n\\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. \\n\\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \\n\\nPlease contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part. \\n\\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, visit the links below and read. \\n\\n[URL]http://www.the-idler.com[/URL]  \\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]  \\n\\nSincerely, \\nO.C.Savimbi. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I am writing, following the impressive\\ninformation about you through one of my friends WORKS WITH THE BURKINA \\nCHAMBERS firm.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $U.S15.5Million dollars\\n(fifteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars)  in an account that \\nbelongs\\n\\nto one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in\\nNovember 2004  in a plane crash.\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless\\n\\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\\nindicated in our banking  guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt\\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at\\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon\\nthis discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to\\nmake this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next\\n\\nof kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\nThe banking law and guidling here stipulates that  if such money remained\\nunclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occassioned by the fact  that the customer was a foreigner\\n\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in\\nrespect  to the  provision of a foriegn account, 10% will be set aside for\\nexpenses occured during the business and 60% would be for me and my\\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according  to the percentage indicated.\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation wherein the money will be remitted.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch  -free and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you recieve this letter.\\nYours faithful\\nBill & Exchange Manager.\\nYOBO\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLes rvlations de la starac 6 commentes par Jrmy! \\n[URL]http://starac2006.spaces.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I am the above named\\nperson. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I?m now in Nigerian\\nGeneral HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy\\nin LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were  \\nmarried for\\neleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for\\nonly four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his\\ndeath I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home\\nwhich the Bible is against.\\n\\nWhen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten\\nMillion five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this  \\nmoney is\\nstill under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently,  \\nmy Doctor\\ntold me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer\\nproblems.\\n\\nThough what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided\\nto donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual\\nThat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a\\nchurch that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows\\npropagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.\\nThe Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took\\nthis decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and\\nmy husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard\\nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this\\nmoney will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold\\ndecision.\\n\\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going\\nto be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight\\nmy case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in\\nthis regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's\\nrelatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.\\nWith God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward\\nyour personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address,  \\nwith Your\\ntelephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal\\nowner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your\\nnominated Bank Account in your country.\\n\\nI will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as  \\nthe real\\nnext of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and  \\nthe church\\nto always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me\\nthat you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My\\nhappiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to\\nserve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful\\nall through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching\\nfor a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me\\nthat you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as\\nsoon as possible.\\n\\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\\n\\nYours in Christ,\\n\\nMrs. Sussan Adams\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Conectese mas rapido y ahorre hasta un 50%\\n    Tel. 0909.2030 =>  $0,15 IVA incluido el minuto\\n______________________________________________________\\n[URL]http://www.internet.com.uy[/URL] - En Uruguay somos internet\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"URY\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand \\nUnited States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your \\nimpressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole \\narrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the \\ndeceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign \\naccount has been put in place and directives and needed information will be \\nrelayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to \\nassist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMusa Garuba.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER BANK OF AFRICAN . OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. WEST AFRICA Dear  , how are you,first i will explain my self in brief for you before we proceed.I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICAN (BOA)  I am writing to Seek your interest over a business , In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15.5m US dollars (fifteen million five US dollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 15th 2001 in a plane crash at abidjan cote'voire. Since we  got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless his next of kin or relative applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my department now  decided to excape with the fund,and as such we vial to make this business proposal to you so that my bank will release the fund into your account as the next of kin to our bank deceased customer for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for claims and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury. Infact i know the fund will not even go into the bank treasury,but our top bank officials(directors)will only share it among themselves into their accounts. The Banking law and guideline here in burkina faso stipulates that if any customer account or property remains unserviceable or dormant,and unclaimed after five years, the account will be confiscated and transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as reported by the International media.\\n\\nI wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.\\n\\n[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL]\\n\\nhtml This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison.\\n\\nHaving lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country.\\n\\nI have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States Dollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know of the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the knowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk boxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then deposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic courier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic checks at the ports. \\n\\nThe reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be transferred without any problems.\\nFor now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the security company.\\n\\n Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and should\\nalso be handled in the most confidential manner.\\n\\nI have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. \\n\\nIf for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for the investment in your country.\\n\\nSo based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my contact andexistence of my fund a secret.\\n \\nI also require you to make available to me the following\\n \\n1)Your Complete name.\\n \\n2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with you easily.\\n \\n Sincerely Yours,\\n\\nHASSAN   GEORGE   .\\n  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased\\nsince you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at\\nUS$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and\\n40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be\\nincurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your\\ncountry.\\n\\nI have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any\\nclaim we may make.
