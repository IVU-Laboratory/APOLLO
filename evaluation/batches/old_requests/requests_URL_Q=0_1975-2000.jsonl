The only instruction of consequence (to gcc anyway) \\nsince the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 \\nwill use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you \\nwill generally get a few percent improvement out of it.

They're in the process of replacing the compiler's \\ninstruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even \\nbetter job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.\\n\\nAs for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE \\nor SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the \\n-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but \\nthere's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use \\ni387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double \\nprecision floats for example).\\n\\nAFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc \\n3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C \\ncode. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast \\nblock copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.\\n\\n> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce?

SSE supports only single precision floats \\nwhile SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU \\nwhich hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register \\nfile. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs \\nare said to have it as well.

Hettinga Sunday, August 25, 2002 (BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs. Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war between thugs. Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's \"family\" were, of course, the (mostly) Italian thugs. Think Scorsese's upcoming \"Gangs of New York\", only with counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston \"social-club\" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US, only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine - -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets, like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points. As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that \"quality\" of carnage, nation-wide. So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of \"justice\" like so much hamburger. However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was \"greasing\", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence -- on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door, but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous \"bluenoses and busybodies\". It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, \"manageable\" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on. Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now, apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly-legislated \"barriers to competition\" imposed on them by the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry. As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time. And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even, *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us. And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati. In fact, Hayek himself, in \"The Road to Serfdom\", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant imposition, \"for our own good\", of Vietnam-era statist power at the neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had better \"useful idiots\" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover. Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of \"mob\" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting, movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now strictly political, descendents. In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr. Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a \"transfer-price\", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style Vietnam-era Keynesian \"social-cost\" input-output accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in Boston. This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the \"right\" people, for all the \"right\" reasons. As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation that a \"prince\" is just a stationary bandit. Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and, what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J. Edgar Hoover a bandit \"princess\", instead. \"Bandit Queen\", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens -- and real bandits -- everywhere. Cheers, RAH - --------- [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL] &pagewanted=print&position=top The New York Times August 25, 2002 Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX BUTTERFIELD BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca. Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr. Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan, \"as they were having a problem with him,\" according to an F.B.I. log of the conversation. \"Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,\" the F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times. It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England Mafia was involved. But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it. One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I. for $300 million for false imprisonment. His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston office in its effort to bring down the mob. The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston. The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution. \"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself,\" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. \"He allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants.\" Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for Mr. Barboza. Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr. Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and Stephen Flemmi are brothers. The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr. Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot. Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer. In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca \"potentially could be an excellent informant.\" The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have killed seven men, \"and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder.\" Nevertheless, the agent said, \"the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved.\" A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. \"The most frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond,\" the investigator said. \"There is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.\" The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I. agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr. Bulger. Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the F.B.I. looked the other way. One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr. Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say. Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence. Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974. Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each other. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb 3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI =OELD -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things. In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar claim about the \"real\" meaning of one of the ten commandments: \"\"\" > The translations since cause problems at each successive remove We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an issue. > I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment > is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,' This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word \"ratsach\".

ATLAS and EDWARD WONG \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIt was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when\\nhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways\\nlast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner\\nand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and\\nrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped\\nthrough his files and found the number for the Texas\\nPacific Group, an investment firm headed by David\\nBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation\\nfor fixing problem companies. \\n\\nMr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,\\nhad watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of\\n$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed\\nfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600\\nmillion. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in\\nAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. \\n\\nThat search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let\\nTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked\\nRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.\\nSiegel reached. \\n\\nIn June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days\\nbefore US Airways announced its plans to file for\\nbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated\\nabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas\\nPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to\\nkick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep\\nthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to\\nbuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,\\nand take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\\nfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a\\nbetter offer. \\n\\n\"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks\\nwere,\" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in\\nan interview after the bankruptcy filing. \"There aren't\\nmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge to\\ndelve into the airline industry.\" \\n\\nTexas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying\\nbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman\\nmade their names during the recession of the early 1990's\\nwith investments in Continental and America West. The\\nfirm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping\\ncompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its\\nextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. \\n\\nNow the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last\\nyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six\\nacquisitions, most in unloved industries like\\nsemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,\\nit announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been\\nlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding\\nfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. \\n\\nThe most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these\\ndeals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of\\nMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6\\n- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150\\nmillion bank loan. \\n\\nIn the last few years, most firms that specialize in\\nleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and\\nother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -\\nhave been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made\\nmanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are\\nfor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. \\n\\nTexas Pacific is different. \"This is a terrific environment\\nfor them,\" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the\\nBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. \\n\\nMark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the\\nWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: \"Most\\nother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.\\nYou don't see many guys wanting to take on operational\\nfixes.\" \\n\\nLike most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep\\nits inner workings private: its partners rarely grant\\ninterviews and its Web site is perpetually under\\nconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,\\nthe third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for\\nthis article. \\n\\nMr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and\\nbright, patterned socks. \"He likes argyle socks, and they\\ntend to fall down around his ankles,\" said Henry Miller, an\\ninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in\\nhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman\\nargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. \\n\\nWhen a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known\\nfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking\\nin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.\\n\"Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on\\nmy caller I.D., I know it's David calling,\" said one\\ninvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. \\n\\nMr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the\\nchief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.\\nMr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making\\nearly bets in industries like cable television and taking\\nstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,\\nwhich had been seized by the government. Over nearly a\\ndecade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual\\nreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. \\n\\nIn 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.\\nCoulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also\\nworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with\\nMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &\\nCompany, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. \\n\\nThe three men have complementary skills, investment bankers\\nand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master\\nstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and\\nthe detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price\\noften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. \\n\\n\"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal\\nmaker,\" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of\\nContinental. \"Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.\\nHe will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will\\napproach investments a little bit more skeptically than\\nDavid does.\" \\n\\nBy the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well\\nestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion\\nfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To\\ncelebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San\\nFrancisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a\\nparty. \\n\\nBut as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific\\nhesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no\\ndeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate\\nblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but\\nstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the\\nbusinesses untenable. \\n\\nInstead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\\ninvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during\\nthat stretch. \\n\\n\"They started to cash out early in the cycle,\" said Mario\\nGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money\\nmanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\\ninvestors. \\n\\nThe good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas\\nPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\\nneeded its help. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\\nrough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health\\nmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\\nmid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new\\nmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a\\n$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian\\nmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than\\nquadrupled. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at\\nthe top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million\\ninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for\\nwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,\\nhas been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of\\nBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand\\nfor luxury goods. \\n\\nTexas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a\\nsemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,\\nboth of which filed for bankruptcy. \\n\\nSome of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's\\nperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\\ntwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. The\\nfirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\\nincluding investments made through March 1997, should\\nreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific\\ninvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997\\n- could return less than half that, this investor\\nestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on\\nthese investments before the stock market sank. \\n\\nBut because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\\nin the second fund, profits on these investments could\\nrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new\\nmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as the\\neconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, \"their\\nreturns look pretty good when you consider that some other\\nfunds won't return any capital\" to investors. \\n\\nBut with the weak economy throwing many companies into\\ntrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\\nsuccess, the investor said. \"They should do exceptionally\\nwell,\" he said. \\n\\nTexas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It\\nrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure\\ntroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except\\nfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it\\nreplaces managers. \\n\\nLess than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,\\nfor example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his\\nold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it\\nto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. \\n\\nContinental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then\\nbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and\\nin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief\\nexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul\\nof the company and is now considered a great turnaround\\nartist of the industry. \\n\\n\"The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob\\nFerguson,\" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for\\nthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the\\nthinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982\\nBraniff bankruptcy. \"He chose Bethune over his longtime\\nfriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\\nbetter job.\" \\n\\nAt America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more\\nextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was\\nled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. \\n\\nW. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.\\nCoulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\\nchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.\\nParker said the two men quickly realized they had \"somewhat\\nkindred spirits.\" \\n\\nThe board replaced most senior managers at America West,\\nexcept William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped\\ndown last September. His restructuring plan had made the\\nairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\\nbankruptcy in August 1994. \\n\\nTexas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth\\nabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and\\nthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. \\n\\n\"These are not passive investors, nor am I,\" said Donald L.\\nSturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's\\nboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. \"You're active.\\nYour money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake.\" \\n\\nAfter overseeing managers who worked successfully with\\nunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a\\ngood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways\\nwas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris\\nChiames, a spokesman for the airline. \\n\\nMr. Siegel wanted an investor who would \"be as labor\\nfriendly as possible,\" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can\\nstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the\\nbillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed\\ninterest. \\n\\nTexas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with\\nGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two\\nyears of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the\\nchain's franchisees - even before the company, which had\\nbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for\\nsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National\\nFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger King\\nfranchisees. \\n\\n\"We liked what they had to say about the human component of\\nthe businesses they buy,\" Mr. Josephson said. Many other\\nowners, he added, \"are dismissive of labor.\" \\n\\nAt Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an\\nexecutive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John\\nDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,\\nwho met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest\\nbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. \\n\\nUnlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored\\nwith the technology industry, despite the failure of so\\nmany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the\\nsemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is\\nhighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. \\n\\nThe firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,\\nwhich makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,\\nhas been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and\\ntook both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of\\nits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger\\ninvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip\\nmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in\\nAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for\\nbankruptcy last year. \\n\\nTexas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third\\ncompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6\\nbillion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last\\nyear. \\n\\nIts latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,\\nmay prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the\\npayment to E.On, based in Dsseldorf, Germany, was actually\\nmore than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal\\nsaid. \\n\\nTexas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company\\nof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to\\nguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas\\nPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of\\nwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. \\n\\n\"They did a good job of timing the acquisition,\" said\\nNabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted\\nthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit\\nsince the fourth quarter of 2000. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly\\nsizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America\\nWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,\\nthe catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. \\n\\nTwo years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount\\nticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75\\nmillion in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to\\ninvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.\\nHotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as\\nPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site\\nbut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until\\nafter the sale. \\n\\nThe contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt\\nHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that\\nthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific\\nremains committed to it. \\n\\nLast spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to\\ntalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman\\nseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the\\nsteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,\\nMr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,\\nMr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet.  \\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Windows and Macintosh\\nhave a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite\\nsure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.\\nThe PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection\\non your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit\\nCopy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.\\nHowever, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is\\nanother archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)\\nby versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these\\nmechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.\\n\\nI would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in\\nText_Selection and report what works well for them.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes. But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well. Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement. (In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.) OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU. =========================== The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. So almost all the literature talks about that. But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board. I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.
