In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who \\ndied along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nanindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, \\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me .

Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a \\nsecret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe \\nthe deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this \\nwas the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat \\nof the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it as a \\nfamily tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the \\nend of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a result \\nof his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the \\nSecurity/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.\\n\\nDue to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the \\nparticipation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will \\nassist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement \\nfor the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The \\nsecurity/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, they \\nbelieve that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. \\nUnfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the \\nconsignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your assistance. \\nI cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total ignorance of \\nthe business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your \\nassistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment while \\nthe rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. \\ni would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the next of \\nkin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i will not \\nbe allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by the \\ngoverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to open an \\naccount as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount of \\nmoney,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are interested \\nin helping me out of this my present situation, contact me immediately \\nthrough my email and i will funish you with other details you need to \\nconclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and of \\nbiliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing it \\nup.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also your \\nhome addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance company \\nhandling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will then \\nmake an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and discuss in \\ndetails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents for \\nnow,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to join \\nyou in your country so that i can continue my studies over there.

SANDTON, 1892,\\nJOHANNESBURG,\\nSOUTH AFRICA.\\nPHONE+27 78 7634400\\n\\n\\nATTN:MD/C.E.O,\\n\\n\\n  Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although\\nwe never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a\\nhighly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your\\nprofile from a human resource profile database on your country.Though, I\\ndo not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile\\npolitical situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in\\nthe CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr.Morgan Yormie Wimpoe , from\\nLiberia, a Country in West Africa. My Father Mr John  Yormie  Wimpoe \\nformer DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My  Father  was\\nfalsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA\\n(CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.\\nyou can verify this from these international newspaper website below:\\n  (i) [URL]http://www.usatoday.com[/URL]\\n  Before he was killed, my Father instructed me to escape with my family\\nto a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that\\nhe left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name\\nwithheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist me\\nin claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security\\ncompany and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shall\\ncome over to your country with my Family so that we can start a new life\\nIf you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance  or why can't i take\\nthe cash transfer by  myself? The answer is that there  was an exclusion\\nclause in the original agreement between the company and my father \\nwhich states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have\\naccess to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred\\nto a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he \\nenvisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any\\nseizure or infiltration of the fund.\\n\\n  My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my\\npresent social status and total ignorance of the business world. I\\nbelieve you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by\\nplacing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request\\nthat you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.\\n\\n  On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you\\nfollow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee\\nof a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the\\nDiplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth\\n$32,Million,(Thirty two million United State Dollars Only). You will be\\ngiven 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be\\nwilling to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I\\nwant to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk\\nfree transaction.\\n\\n  Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers where\\nyou can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable\\nme send some other important information across to you. This proposal is\\nhighly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction\\nrequiring trust and Confidentiality.

Upon maturity, the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month, I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. \\n\\nFinally, I discovered from my client\ufffds contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D\ufffdIvoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.\\n\\nI am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. \\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man\ufffds labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.\\n\\nI wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. \\n\\nIf you are interested, please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com.

This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you, view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.\\n\\nI am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with !\\n a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;\\n(i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the \\nforeign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the \\nwhole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is \\nfirst to furnish us with the following through my email address.\\n1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )\\n2.) The beneficiary's name,\\n3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a \\nsmooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria \\nGovernment Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me \\nimmediately through my personal E-mail: uzoromaobi@o2.pl or call me on my \\nreceiving number:234-8058437715 for more details.\\nBest regards as we look forward to hearing from you soonest.\\nYour Sincerely,\\nDR UZOMA OBI.\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at JU-Schrobenhausen\\n- [URL]http://ju-schrobenhausen.de[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
