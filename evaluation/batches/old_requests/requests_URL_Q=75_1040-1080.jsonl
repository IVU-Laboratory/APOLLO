While not valid 100% of the time, it's a \\nreasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at\\ncode, it's easier to see how control moves through a \\nfunction if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The\\nspecific example of replacing a break in a while loop with\\na modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to\\nlook in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the\\nloop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular\\nexample wasn't really that good, since the extra test was \\nadding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.\\nWhich is much the same as a break really.)\\n\\nThe idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as \\npossible when he sees the code.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select\\nblock makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or \\none case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.\\nLeaving out break statements breaks this assumption.\\n\\nMy point is that, while there are a few situations where it\\nmakes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to \\nconsider the break at the end of each case more like the\\nbrace at the end of the while block.  \\n\\nIn fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language\\nwas designed such that the continue statement meant fall through\\nand break wasn't needed:\\n\\n   select (x) {\\n      case 1:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n      case 2:\\n         /* do something - falls through to next case*/\\n         continue;\\n      case 3:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n      default:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n   }\\n\\nStill, hindsight and all that.

They are deployed in a cellular  fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming. On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to  a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is  quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration. The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't  work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation  and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most  often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux  bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous  is broken as well). \" [[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge  our networks? ]] \" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC  headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the  right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on  how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in  hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points). In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or  wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about  turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. \" [[ Is this true? ]] \" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other  methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... \" [[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge.  But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right. Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure  in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other),  no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places  such a suggestion would stumble. Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring  a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging. That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox. Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun. Just a pseudo random thought.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...\\n\\n[URL]http://www.openp2p.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run\\non the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\\nimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is\\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\\n\\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\\nbrowser.\"\\n\\n===\\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\\n\"home\" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\\napplications.\"\\n\\n\"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\\nconnections can download portions, or \"stripes,\" of a file from several\\ncached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles\\nthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that\\nthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this\\ndigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header\\nfor the file.\"\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In recent years,\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold, studies show. \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \\n\\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and I'm disbanding it.\" \\n\\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\\n\"There's this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it's better that\\nthey end.\" \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\\nas more important. \\n\\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad. \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me.\" \\n\\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \\n\\n\"Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we're starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics.\" \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior.\" \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It's\\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend's\\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\\nLerner's patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They'll\\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\\nshe finds out.\" \\n\\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and\\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\\nisn't,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one. \\n\\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover there's something important they don't like about\\nthe other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nother's dislike criteria.\" \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \\n\\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It's also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another person's limitations.\" \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one. \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\\nget together, ever. \\n\\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while you're healthy and your life and work\\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on a very remote machine.

What threat does Outlook pose to your organization? It places the company, corporate network and data at risk. Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company reputation and liability with customers at risk, and proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned. >> Have you looked into using a custom sequences file? > More detail please?

I've upgraded both my laptop and my  home box from (null) to RH8.0 and didn't encounter any issues though. --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It looks like libsigc++ is no longer included in the distribution, and gtkmm won't compile without it :-/ I guess I'll have to repackage it myself for 8.0 (assuming it's possible).

The only little (unimportant) catch is to replace \"kernel-headers\" by \"glibc-kernheaders\", a simple \"apt-get install glibc-kernheaders\" taking care of that. Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded, some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered as the newest, thus being kept on the system. As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
