Now he has a substantial amount deposited in a \\nbank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that \\nthis account will be discovered because similar accounts \\nin Switzerland and England were previously discovered and \\nfrozen by the governments of those countries in \\ncollaboration with the Government of Nigeria.\\n\\nPrecisely, my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the \\ngovernment of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the \\nSwiss banking authorities, this is a confirmable matter, \\neven as the existence of the fund mentioned above is \\nconfirmable. \\n\\nNow it is his intention to migrate with his family out of \\nNigeria \\ntowards the Middle East and he depends so much on this \\nfund, thus he is\\nlooking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will \\nreceive the money\\ndiscreetly and then transfer the money at a latter date to \\na neutral account to be established in Lebanon when he \\nfinally succeeds with his emigration plan.\\n\\nIf you accept my proposition and agree to participate in \\nthis \\ntransaction, you will in no case whatsoever undertake \\nrisk- expend \\nmoney or execute any unreasonable task- whereas you will \\nbe well remunerated, in principle you will receive 10% of \\nthe amount transferred to you once the transaction is \\ncompleted.\\n\\nApart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in \\na Security \\nCompany (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support \\nof the cause of Charity in India, but it was never \\nretrieved before the demise \\nof my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve \\nthis money in addition to the money with the bank in \\nNigeria. The money with the Security Company is Thirty one \\nMillion American Dollars in one hundred dollar bills.\\n\\nSince I do not know in what vein you will take this \\nmissive I have kept \\nthe information peripheral, I will be posited to give \\nfurther information upon your acceptance and will also \\nintroduce you to my client eventually.  I hope I will be \\nable to work with you earnestly unto our joint success.\\n\\nI await your response eagerly.\\n\\nRespectfully.\\n\\nAbu Kyari esquire.\\nWelcome to Sudan pioneer ISP\\n[URL]http://www.sudanet.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"AUT\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).\\n \\nAll subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now \\ndecided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.\\n \\nThe reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside \\nmarriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjs property for her \\nand her son.\\n \\nYou must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing \\nyou as the only beneficiary.\\n \\nThe banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not \\npermanently resident in Switzerland.\\n \\nFor your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank \\nfunds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are \\nconcerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.\\n \\nIf you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will \\nproceed.\\n \\nI must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at [URL]www.royaltrust.com[/URL]\\n \\nWe await your timely response.\\n \\nBest Regards\\n \\nDR PETER CLAPTON\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"JPN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Why wouldn't you jump at this chance? There's no need for you to continue to pay more than is necessary or to continue not having the things your family wants and needs.    We're a nationwide mortgage lender. We're N0T a broker. And we can guarantee you the best rate and the best deal possible for you. But only if you take action today.   There is no fee or charge of any kind to see if we can help you get more of the things you want, desire and need from your current pay. You can easily determine if we can help you in just a few short minutes. We only provide information in terms so simple that anyone can understand them. You won't need to be a lawyer to see the savings, this we promise.   We offer both first and second home loans and we will be happy to show you why your current loan is the best for you. 0r why you should replace it. And once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.  Take a couple of minutes and use the link below that works for you. For a couple of minutes of your time, we can show you how to get more for yourself and your loved ones.

I am contacting you concerning a customer and an\\ninvestment placed under our banks management; as a matter of fact it was 3\\nyears ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this\\nmail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information\\nyou come by as a result of this email.I contacted you independently of our\\ninvestigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like\\nto intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to\\nyou.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank to\\nengage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services\\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37\\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over\\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made\\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief\\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially\\ngiven the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on\\nnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however I\\nencouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The\\nfavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on\\n600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative\\ninvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various\\nopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of\\noperation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this point\\nat over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full\\npotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on\\ninvestments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he\\nneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He\\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in\\nEurope.I informed him that our bank would have to make special\\narrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process,\\nthe bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for\\nbanking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later\\ncame around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was\\nasking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict\\nsince the incidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland\\nEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts\\ndeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that\\nhandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate\\naccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar\\nespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line\\nwith instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money\\nthere in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was\\nthe last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002.\\nIn June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of\\nthe inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding\\nposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the\\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and\\nI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I\\nmade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of\\nlocating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four\\ndays later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently\\ndead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather more\\ninformation and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately\\nlaunched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert\\nabout the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you\\nare familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our\\nservices usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from\\nconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In\\nthe field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will\\nknow of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors\\nuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives\\nthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I\\nsaid, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart\\nfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in\\nour care, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\\nshould have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several\\nmonths were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private\\ninvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is\\nthis investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact\\ndetails and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a\\npotential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliated\\nwith this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that I\\nam the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to\\nreceive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being\\na foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died\\nwith no known or identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the\\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late\\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the\\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to\\nour bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert\\nthe deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering our\\nbank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out\\nof the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have\\nmy way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I\\nwant you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking\\nworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.\\nThe world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for\\nthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you\\nshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I\\npropose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the deposit\\ndetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them\\nto do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the\\nfinance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer\\nconcluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions\\nin relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The\\nfinance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the\\ndeposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to\\nany party that comes forward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of\\nthe deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family\\nbut however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I am\\nprepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to\\nrelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt\\nof the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no\\nmore; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them\\nrelease the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.I would\\nhave gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have\\ndrawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit,\\nbut on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as\\nthe beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have\\nthe deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank\\nof the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then\\nofficially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to\\nrelease the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The\\nalternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another\\nbank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to\\nthink of receiving the money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the\\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in\\nthis project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do\\nnot be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you,\\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy my\\ncareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this\\nbut people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations\\nrun the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, I\\ndo not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to\\nunderstand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime.

I am writing following an opportunity in my department here in the bank that will be of immense benefit both of us. \\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10 million Ten million united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer the Late Mr Smith B.Andrea an American oil engineer with Petro Technical Services Sarl who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife. \\nYou read more on the crash on visiting this Site.[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] airlines.list/smith.html. \\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relatio n to the deceased as indicated in our bankingguidelines. \\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his wife [Patty Andrea] died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. \\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained after six and half years, the money will then be transferred into Government treasury as unclaimed funds. \\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the foreign partner, while the balance will be for me. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. \\nPlease be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this trans action. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. \\nAs soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to your yet to be provided account has been finalised. \\nWe will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. Please in your response include your telephone number for easy communication between us. \\nBest Regards, \\nDr. Eric Morgan. \\nPLEASE NOTE: \\nThe material being sent to you contains PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL information only for the use of the addressee(s) named above. \\nIf the reader of this message is not the intended recipient, please note that any dissemination, distribution, or copying of this communication is prohibited. \\nIt is requested that anyone who receives this communication in error notify the sender immediately by e-mail reply and destroy all copies of the tran smission received. \\nThanks ! \\nFROM Dr.ERIC MORGAN \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.   Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand US.Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.   This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Ministry of Justice here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.   Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e- mail to confirm whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal.     I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please, remember to treat this matter very confidential , because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service .Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. You can contact me through this e-mail address:- mbengu@37.com Lastly,please try to send me your telephone and fax number so     that we candiscuss in details.

I am Mr.Jonathan Mutambara, In \\ncharge of Credit and Foreign bills of my Bank, AMALGAMATED BANK OF \\nSOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).   I  have an obscured business suggestion for you. \\nOne of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued \\n$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not \\nbeen operated for the past six years.  \\n   \\n>From my investigations and \\nconfirmations, the owner  of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a \\ncitizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight \\nAF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your \\nperusal you can view this web site:[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything \\nas  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members \\nwho are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.\\n\\nAlso \\nInformation from the National Immigration stated  that he was also \\nsingle on entry into South Africa.\\n  \\nI have secretly discussed this \\nmatter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable \\nforeign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal \\nalone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we \\nare not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually \\nraise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we \\nstill work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a \\nsecond party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of \\nkin with informations which will be made available to you.\\n \\nThis \\ntransaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate \\nand does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any \\nother illegal act. \\n   \\nThe sharing of the fund between us, is as \\nfollows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and \\ncommitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my \\ncolleague's. \\n \\nForward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net \\n  \\nBest \\nRegards, \\nMr.Jonathan Mutambara\\nEmail: jomutambara@fsmail.net \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}
