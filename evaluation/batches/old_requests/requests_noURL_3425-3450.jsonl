The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \\nof a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the \\nbusiness and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable  the \\nimmediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first  to the \\nbank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application \\nthat i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private \\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location \\nwhere in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of \\nthe application.I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction  is \\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all  \\nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer.

My name is Mr.Bernard Martin and I work in the International  Operation Department in a Bank here in London. I feel quite safe  dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium  (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it  because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However,  this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated  as such.  At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is  100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT  MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN  ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader. Until his death,The Late Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge  investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a  matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND  FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London  which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about  this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant  domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED  AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet  investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed  away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will  approve this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the  a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for  the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with  legal claims to the account Holder,  Therefore I need your cooperation  in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in  order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down  now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 -  February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self- made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister  of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from  office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14,  2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated  as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese  capital, for more information please log on to([URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL] I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I  DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE  WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT  BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

I am writing following an opportunity in my office\\nthat will be of immense benefit to both of us.In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of\u00a320.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty\\nmillion five hundred thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs\\nto one of our  foreign customers Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American  who\\nunfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight\\n261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only\\ndaughter.\\n\\nYou shall read more  about the crash on visiting this site.\\n\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nSince we got information about  his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we cannot\\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to\\nthe deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n\\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only\\ndaughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the\\nknowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to\\nmake business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or\\nbeneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into\\nGovernment treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained\\nafter eight years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as\\nunclaimed funds.\\n\\nWe agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while\\nthe balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country\\nfor the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once\\nthis money gets into your account.Please be honest to me and trust is our\\nwatchword in this transaction.\\n\\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free.As soon as you receive\\nthis mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all\\nnecessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has\\nbeen finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your\\nresponse.\\n\\nPlease if you are interested in this project contact me for further\\ndirectives.\\n\\nBest regards\\n\\nMr.Charles Greene\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
