Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad.  Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad? Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto  or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of  programming syntax to make sure people use loops or recursion? <> Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'. For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance? Hmm. I'm only laughing on the outside  My smile is just skin deep  If you could see inside I'm really crying  You might join me for a weep. <> --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

Thanks that helps.  There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to \"ac-100\" which I thought would be zero.   So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions... What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net]  Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby,  Couple of things:  If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting. Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user). apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate. cheers, vipul.

Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you might be running in a RH system. Packages like kernel-headers, kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched.

I have one more question though.  I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight? ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2 When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install. There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.

I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864 of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules each.  They weigh 125 kg. You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that. It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage. Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time. ------------------------   From: \"R. A. Hettinga\"    Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel...

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like 1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW) Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the \"capactior is the wrong choice\" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve. But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design. - Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg   [URL]http://www.mithral.com[/URL]   beberg@mithral.com --- end forwarded text --  ----------------- R.

I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type \"make\" after I get the output from the ./configure. \\n\\nHowever, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing \\n* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config\\n* make oldconfig\\n* make dep\\nThe 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?\\n\\nAlso, when I was in the pctel directory and typed \"make\", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after \"make\". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory\\n\\nThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?\\n\\nIt's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience.

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert into apt and let loose... :) Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC.

There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good  starting point to search is [URL]http://www.freshmeat.net[/URL] However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as  they are on Windows platform for two main reasons: 1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are  respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters. 2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this  software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and  open source.

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function  check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules  files still lurking around?

Just mirror the needed directories (e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one installation.
