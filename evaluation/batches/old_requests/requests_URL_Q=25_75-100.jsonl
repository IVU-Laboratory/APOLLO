Prepare LILO to boot the new disk    (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)    We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot    Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want    to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will    become the first hard disk.    Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:         disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second                                       # disk as if it were the first                                       # disk (BIOS ID 0x80).         boot=/dev/hdb                 # Install LILO on second hard                                       # disk.         map=/new-disk/boot/map        # Location of \"map file\".         install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's                                       # boot sector.         prompt                        # Have LILO show \"LILO boot:\"                                       # prompt.         timeout=50                    # Boot default system after 5                                       # seconds.

I've always been under the impression that\\nthe uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's\\nlong-standing \"10:00 A.M. policy\", in place until the decision in 1963 to\\nswitch over to \"let-it-burn\".\\n\\nThe 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from\\nEurope, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a\\npolicy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they\\ndirectly threatened property.\\n\\n40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff\\nleft to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement\\nforests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. \\n\\nI would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors\\nsquarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes\\nupon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of\\nmaterials, location, and landscaping.\\n\\n-- \\nnjl\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
