Our Bank is a \\nfinancial institution specialising in private banking to individual customers who likes confidentiality in their financial dealings.I have intrest of investing in your company as such i would like to make contact with you for assistance.\\nOn January 13,1987 an Indian-American mining consultant with the \\nPetrogas Gas Systems BV Environmental Systems, Mr. Dixit Shanti made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty Four calendar months, valued at \\nUS$49,500,000.00 (Forty Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in the Bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie \\nflight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he \\ndied intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his \\nnext-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see\\n[URL]http://www.geocities.com[/URL]\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit \\nShanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents with\\nus, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\\nUS$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or\\noffice including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the\\nservices of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and\\ncourt affidavits which will put you in good standing as the \\nnext-of-kin.\\nA bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later \\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the \\nratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.\\nBe informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to \\nthis project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my \\nposition as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execution \\nof this transaction. If you are interested, please\\nrevert back to me.\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capable and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar\\nThanks and regards.\\nMr. Usman Ramat Shehu\\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \\n[URL]www.freeserve.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

This \\nmoney was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as\\npersonal belongings and as such the security company does \\nnot know the true content of the boxes.This money was \\noriginally meant to be used for his political campaign. \\nBecause I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me \\nwith the relevant document papers relating to this deposit \\nbefore he died of cardiac arrest.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with \\nan offshore Security Company to move this money as a \\nconsignment through diplomatic means to their offshore \\naffiliated office where you will be required to put claim \\nto the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the \\nconsignment. You should know that this business is safety \\nand 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or \\nTerrorist fund.\\n \\nIf you are interested to carry out this transaction with \\nme, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general \\nexpenses, and 75% for us.\\n\\nYou are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full \\nname and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement \\nthat will guide and protect both of us in this transaction \\nalso which will be used to effect the change of ownership \\nof the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the \\nconsignment.\\n\\nAlso send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy \\ncommunication\\n \\nOnce you notify me your willingness by sending the above \\nrequirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 \\n(seven) working days.\\n\\nI will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on \\nmy Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-\\nmail: williamsfalana@caramail.com \\n\\nBest regards, \\nBarrister Williams Falana {SAN} \\n______________________________________________________\\nBo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - [URL]http://www.caramail.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n--=_NextPart_Caramail_0054031032174770_ID--\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I have decided \\nto seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal \\ndescribed hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it \\nas a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.\\n\\nWithin the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an \\ndirector and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in \\nour possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Seven Million, One \\nHundred Thousand united states dollars (US$27,100,000.00) which we want to \\ntransfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign \\ncompany/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable \\ncompany/individual account depending on your convenience.\\nMore so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil \\nService Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence \\nyour importance the whole transaction. This amount (US$27.1m) represents the \\nbalance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a \\nforeign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. \\nThough the actual contract cost have been paid to the original \\ncontractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have \\nin principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer \\n(K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an \\napplication through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the \\ntransfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be \\nwilling to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% \\nof the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous \\nexpenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat \\nit with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.

The published lists contain all types of dormant\\naccounts, like interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts,\\nsafe deposit boxes, custody accounts, Numbered accounts and\\nnon-interest-bearing transaction accounts.\\n\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on\\naccounts due to non-Swiss Citizens. I discovered a dormant account of Mr.\\nClement Adene, with a credit balance of 45,000,000 million US dollar plus\\naccumulated interest.\\nThe beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no \"WILL\"\\nand no possible records to trace any of his close family members or\\nrelations.\\n\\n\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed\\nfunds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit\\nbalance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law\\nfor management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate\\nliving no wills.\\n\\nBeing a top executive member at ICEP, I have all secret details and\\nnecessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch.

I will visit your country\\nfor the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once\\nthis money gets into your account.Please be honest to me and trust is our\\nwatchword in this transaction.\\n\\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free.As soon as you receive\\nthis mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all\\nnecessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has\\nbeen finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your\\nresponse.\\n\\nPlease if you are interested in this project contact me for further\\ndirectives on paul_clark01@yahoo.co.uk or paul_clarke02@yahoo.co.uk\\n\\nBest regards\\n\\nMr Paul Clarke\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        John William  61 Fann Residence Dakar Senegal E-mail:johw75@yahoo.com   Attention: The President/CEO. I am Dr John William, Bank Manager in one of the leading banks here in Dakar Senegal. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. A contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation made a numbered time Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$27,000,000.00 (Twenty seven Million Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers, Teaser Petroleum Corporation that MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany died in a plane crash along with his entire family in July 2000.PLEASE TAKE A CAREFULL LOOK AT THE BBC PUBLISHED Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK:[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]  Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigated and discovered that Mr. Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$27,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Senegal, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt governme!  nt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that I will place every necessary information about you in the late account owner\ufffds file and our computer data base as his next of kin entitled to inherit his deposited fund. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 30% for you. The remaining 20% will be for any expenses we might incurred during the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the su!  ccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, ple ase reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email address. johw75@yahoo.com   Regards, DrJohn William.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I have not particularly lived my life \\nso well, as I never really cared for anyone not even \\nmyself but my business.Though I am very rich, I was \\nnever generous,I was always hostile to people and only \\nfocus on my business as that was the only thing I \\ncared for,but now I regret all this as I now know that \\nthere is more to life than just wanting to have or \\nmake all the money in the world. \\nI believe when I have a second chance to come to this \\nworld I would live my life a different way from how I \\nhad lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have \\nwilled and given most of my properties and assets to \\nmy immediate and extended family members and as well \\nas a few close friends. \\nTo correct my wrong past life, I have decided to give \\nalms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one \\nof the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have \\ndistributed money to some charity organizations in the \\nU.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \\ndeteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self \\nanymore. \\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my \\naccounts and distribute the money which I have there \\nto charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they \\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do \\nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have\\nleft for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash\\ndeposit of four million dollars that I have with a Fiducial Company Abroad,\\nI will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity\\norganizations and you must be sending me informations of how it was\\ndisbursed either by email or otherwise . I have set aside 10% for you for\\nyour time and patience. \\nThanks. \\nMiguel Wayne.\\nNB \\nPlease do not share my email addess with anyone as I \\nhave received some emails from some unscrupulos people \\nclaiming to be charity organisations and other weird \\nstories. \\n\\nNOTE:You must reply this mail to me through\\n: miguelwayne@velocall.com for the above reasons I have told you about.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nsent by Excite Inbox - [URL]http://inbox.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\npowered by Excite UK - [URL]http://www.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

The message could be strange but real, if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am Mrs. Nazek Hariri, wife of the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr Rafiq Hariri, who was assassinated on 14 February 2005, along with 20 others,near the St. George Hotel in Beirut.In the wake of his assassination on 14 February 2005, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a fact-finding mission to investigate the killing. Arriving in Beirut on 25 February, the mission interviewed Lebanese officials and politicians, from both the government and opposition, studied the Lebanese investigation and legal proceedings, examined the crime scene and collected evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt also interviewed some Witnesses.The report emphasizes that it is impossible to identify the culprits until the perpetrators have been brought to justice, but blames the Syrian government, which it charges with exerting influence that goes beyond the reasonable exercise of cooperative or neighbourly relations, with primary responsibility for the political tension that preceded the assassination, by its (interference) with the details of governance in Lebanon in a heavy-handed and inflexible manner.Since the perpetrators of these evil act has not been brought to justice, l have the feelings that l am not also save here in Beirut.\\n\\n\\n\\nI intend leaving Lebanon for greener pasture.During my husband's regime as the Prime Minister of Lebanon, He realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. The money was deposited by my husband in my name, Mrs. Nazek Hariri, in a Finance Firm in Europe. I have plans to invest this money outside Lebanon.I am contacting you because am looking for a trusted and reliable person that will represent me in Europe to claim the money on my behalf.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have sent a notification letter to the financier institution, that the consignment will be collected by the family foreign business partner.Why l need a foreign partner is that, as an Arab woman, the tradition forbids me to run any business with my son (Saadeddine). Since he was not aware of the money from the very first beginning.When I receive your positive response I will then give you details of the Finance firm, and the amount involves.\\n\\nBest regards and God bless,\\n\\nMrs.Nazek Rafiq Hariri\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nNo banners.

I am Mrs Kathy\\nOlds,wife of Late Mr Martin Olds,a famous zimbabwean\\ntobacco/cattle farmer who was murdered in a farmland\\ndispute in Zimbabwe.Please gothrough: \\n[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL] \\nI got yourcontact through a search on the internet\\nhere in South Africa. I do not know your person but I\\nam relying on faith to see me through. During the war\\nwaged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the\\nsupporters and cohorts of President Robert Mugabe to\\nclaim all the white owned farms in our country, my\\nlate husband belonged to one of the classes of farmers\\nalso targeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because he\\ndid not support theirideas and policies of taking\\nwhite farmers \\nland by force. \\n\\nBlackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my\\nhusband's house on April 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in\\nMacheke/Virginia district and murdered him because of\\nhis insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain\\ntheir farmlands despite the  recently introduced land\\nreforms\"Act\" in Zimbabwe by \\nthe head of state,President Robert Mugabe. \\nUntil his death he was one of the prominent members of\\nthe Zimbabwean Farmers'Union (ZFU)But before my\\nhusbands death, he first escaped safely into\\nneighbouring South Africa with his life time fortune\\nof US$37m(Thirty-seven Million \\nUSdollars)cash, important documents of property title\\nand other \\nvaluables which were concealed and secured in a trunk\\nbox, and \\ntransported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. \\nThe consignment box is currently safely lodged and\\nsecured in the vaults of a private security firm here\\nin Johannesburg after which he returned to zimbabwe\\nwhile he was killed. The fund was meant for the\\npurchase of new tractors,machinery and agro-allied\\nchemicals for our new farms acquired in Swaziland. \\nThis land problem came when President  Robert Mugabe\\nintroduced a new land act\"ModusOperandi\" reform which\\nwholly affected the rich white farmers. A lot of\\npeople were killed because of this land reforms \"Act\"\\nof which my late husband was one of the main\\ntargets.Based on this,I had to flee the country with\\nmy \\ntwo children and my only late husband personal\\nassistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his personal\\nassistant{PA}. \\nWe are now in south africa as political assylum\\nseekers/refugees. \\nWe decided to contact you to assist us in removing\\nthis money my husband kept in a private security\\ncompany here in south africa to your account or any\\npart of the world for investments as the\\nmonetary/investment laws here in south africa\\nprohibits refugees and illegal immigrants from\\noperating bank accounts or be involved in any\\ntransaction/investment. Based on this, \\nwe are contacting you hoping that you will assist us\\nwith this transaction. \\nAs a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility of\\nseeking a genuine and an honest person who will assist\\nus in investing this money in a highly profit yeilding\\nventures without the knowledge of my\\ncountry(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on taking\\neverything my late husband \\nhad after confiscating all his farmlands and\\ninvestments in Zimbabwe \\n. \\nWe are absolutely left with nothing except the money\\nhe deposited in a private security company here in\\nsouth africa.
