Though, this medium \\n(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because \\nit still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this \\ncorrespondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.\\n\\nAt first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and \\ntrouble free to both parties.\\n\\nMy name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account \\nmanagement section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime \\nbanks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant \\ndomiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million \\ntwo hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet \\ninvestigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago \\nwith his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  \\naccount and no other person knows about this account.\\n\\nI am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner \\nand he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  \\nforeigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c \\nis a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he \\nhas no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and \\nnobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner \\nwho can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I \\nwill provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation \\nin this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance \\nto the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this \\ndormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.\\n\\nI will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to \\nclaim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide \\nyour safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement  that \\nwill ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to \\nnominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  \\nphone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in \\nhandling this transaction.\\n\\nAt the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total \\ntransfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  \\nexpenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The \\nfund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer \\nUSD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you  after the \\nsuccessful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  \\nhave the remaining balance of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account \\nonly after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any \\ndisappointment from your side.\\n\\nI am looking forward to have a reply from you through my E-mail or you can \\ncall me or fax me.If you want to call my No. dial the way you use to call \\nother countries, do not put South African area code which is 27, because it \\nis a satellite phone which I bourght for this transaction for the security \\nreason because our local land line here is not secured.\\n\\n\\nLet me hear from you.\\nBest Regards,\\nMR.TONY HILL\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nSearch & browse smarter, faster - download MSN Search Toolbar today, it's \\nFREE!

I meant to contact [URL]http://taint.org[/URL] webmaster,\\nAm I correct, I hope?\\n\\nActually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write \\nyou before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of \\nher too.\\n\\nSo, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.\\n\\nI have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, \\npossibly you will find it interesting.\\n\\nPeople are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?\\n\\nThe thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from\\nRussia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for\\nconsiderably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or \\npay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all\\nprogramming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content\\nwriting, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may\\naccept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and\\ndevote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.\\nAlternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more\\nfeatures to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from\\n$12, and an average of $18 an hour.\\n\\nI have put links to their works at [URL]www.antee.com[/URL]\\n\\nAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their\\nspecialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.\\nSo, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet \\ndeadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant \\nis online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also \\ntheir company has local consultants in many states throughout the \\nUSA, in Europe and Australia.\\n\\nSo, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?\\n\\nThank you very much,\\nOksana Svetlova.\\noksana@antee.com\\n\\nPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me \\nknow a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

The bank official Will destroy all documents of \\ntransaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place \\nand to build confidence you\\ncan call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone \\nwhich I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know \\nthat this business is confidential.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business,you will be given 35% of the total \\namount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\\n\\nI look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.\\nyou can contact me with:   mnoah12@hotmail.com\\nYours truly,\\n\\nMr Mona Noah.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.

I am writing following an opportunity in my department here in the bank that will be of immense benefit to both of us. \\n\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10 million Ten million united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer the Late Mr Smith B.Andrea an American oil engineer with Petro Technical Services Sarl who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife. \\n\\n\\nYou read more on the crash on visiting this Site.[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] airlines.list/smith.html.\\n\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his wife [Patty Andrea] died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. \\n\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. \\n\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained after six and half years, the money will then be transferred into Government treasury as unclaimed funds. \\n\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the foreign partner, while the balance will be for me. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. \\n\\n\\nPlease be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction.

No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. \\n I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.\\n We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.\\n Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.\\n The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business . \\n There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\n Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n Please upon your approval of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:1.) The beneficiary's name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\n I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.\\n I do not find this move against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot afford to let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and I won't let it pass me by.If you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. \\n There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.\\n Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:da_sarr@katamail.com or call me on my private telephone number: +221-4488469 for further discussion.\\nThanks and God bless,\\nMr.David Sarr\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi -\\n\\n( [URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL] )\\n\\nYou get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.\\nMost of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.\\nAnd they expect you to listen to them?\\n\\nEnough.\\n\\nIf you want to make money with your computer, then you should\\nhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making\\na large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will\\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\\n\\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\\ncan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send\\nan email, you can do this.  No special \"skills\" are required.\\n\\nHow much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \\ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\\nand rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if\\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\\njust the thing you are looking for.\\n\\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,\\nthere are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -\\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\\neach month also).\\n\\nInterested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a\\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\\ndecide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still\\nhave that \"burning desire\" to find an opportunity that will reward\\nthem incredibly well, if they work at it.\\n\\nTo grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the \\n web address [URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL]  and send me an email with following \\n information\\n\\n\"Send me a free membership!\"\\n\\nBe sure to include your:\\n1. First name\\n2. Last name\\n3. Email address (if different from above)\\n\\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\\nas soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.\\n\\nIf you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)\\nyou are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,\\nVery Cheap ISP package and many many more,\\n\\nYou can also go to the web address:\\n[URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL]\\n\\nThat's all there's to it.\\n\\nWe'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\\n\\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nHugh Zou\\n\\nP.S. After having several negative experiences with network\\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\\nThis is different - there is value, integrity, and a\\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\\nand finally make real money on the internet.\\n\\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\\nprogram for FREE.

Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.

I have urgent and very confidential  business proposal \\nfor you.An American Gold consultant/contractor with the burkina  faso west  \\nAfrican Solid Gold Corporation,mr  Morris Thompson made a numbered time \\n(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$10,000,000.00 (TEN \\nMillion Dollars) in my branch.\\n\\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered \\nfrom his contract employers, the west African Solid Gold Corporation that \\nMorris Thompson died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight 261(for more \\ninformation about this crash and person you can contact this website:\\n[URL]http://archives.cnn.com[/URL]\\nsince we got this information about his death. On further investigation, I \\nfound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his \\nnext of kin was fruitless.\\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr  Morris \\nThompson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, \\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. This sum of \\nUS$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the  interest is being \\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever \\ncome forward to claim it.\\nAccording to Laws of Republic OF BURKINA  FASO,  at the expiration of 4 \\n(four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the burkina  faso \\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i am due to \\nretire from office next year 2007,\\n\\nMy proposal is that I will like you tp come in as a next kin/ foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr.Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this \\nold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government \\nofficials.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and \\naddress so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and \\naffidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.through the bank \\nattorney as soon as you put application to the bank.We shall employ the \\nservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL as  the \\nbank will approve you as  the next of kin and to obtain the necessary \\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the \\ntransfer.\\n\\nA bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then \\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. \\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% \\nfor me and 20% for you.then 5%will be map out for any expenses that may \\noccure during transactions.\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be \\ndone by the attorney as will employ him on  the approval of the bank; i am \\nnotifying  you this as a secret of mine, as a senior bank officer.i knew all \\n  what it takes  to get  this funds out of  the bank. and my position and \\nthat of YOU  qarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Attached here   \\nis a CNN webpage on the unfortunate crash in 1999:   \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nValuable efforts have been made by the bank to get in touch  with any of the \\nAdam's family or relative, but to no avail. His Next of Kin was his wife that \\nwas involved in the crash so for now there is no trace of his family.\\n\\nIt is because of the perceived impossibility of locating a relative of the \\nShaline Adam's family (since all his family are dead) that the bank is making \\nplans to ceed the said amount to the Defence Ministry for the procurement of \\nweapons of war. In order to avert this ugly situation, few of my colleagues \\nand I have decided to contact you and seek your   permission to have you stand \\nas a relative to Late Shaline Adam so that the total amount of US$3.5 Million \\nDollars will be processed and released in your favour into your personal \\naccount.\\n\\nAll documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be   carefully \\nworked out.

Also, your share for offering to assist us and provide the \\nreceiving account will be 10% of the total sum, while 90% will be for my \\ncolleagues and I, which also would be in your account for safe custody and \\nprobable future investment purpose in your country.\\n\\nAs soon as we receive an acknowledgement of your willingness    to accept our \\nproposal, we shall furnish you with further details as we concluded all \\narrangements to have the money transferred to you within 7 working days from \\nthe date of commencement.\\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable to you, then furnish us with your most \\nconfidential telephone and fax numbers  at which   time an application for the \\nfund release will be forwarded in your favour.\\n\\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nAjibola James\\n\\nAlternative mail:jrade2000@caramail.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

If you've been like me, you've been trying\\ntrying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel\\n- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise \\nequipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose\\neither. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less\\nweight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Oh geez, not another\\nmiracle diet pill!\" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but \\nmy sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, \\nso I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing \\nto lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was\\nthe best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,\\nas I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds\\nto 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet\\nat all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!\\n\\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer\\nand received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel\\nthe need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it\\ndoes so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.\\nI am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'\\nabsolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!\\n\\nIf you are frustrated with trying other products, without having \\nany success, and just not getting the results you were promised,\\nthen I recommend the only product that worked for me - \\n'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!\\n\\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Ok, so how does this stuff\\nactually work?\"\\n\\nExtreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which \\nis scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid \\nweight loss. No \"hocus pocus\" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! \\n\\nHere is the bottom line ...\\n\\nI can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without\\nexercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. \\nJust try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence \\nto gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my\\npledge to you.\\n\\nBONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more! \\n\\nTo order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click\\non this link -> [URL]http://www.2002dietspecials.com[/URL]\\n\\nTo see what some of our customers have said about this product, \\nvisit [URL]http://www.2002dietspecials.com[/URL]\\n\\nTo see a list of ingredients and for more information\\non test studies and how it will help you lose weight, visit \\n[URL]http://www.2002dietspecials.com[/URL]\\n\\n**************************************************************\\nIf you feel that you have received this email in error, please \\nsend an email to \"print2@btamail.net.cn\" requesting to be \\nremoved.
