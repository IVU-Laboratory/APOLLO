Greetings to you, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you. After careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize  for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy  of The Republic of South Africa for seven years  running as you will find in the link  below: [URL]http://www.gov.za[/URL]  I will now give you a general overview of the situation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successful businessman was awarded several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with foreign investors in this field. Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husbands business which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad  and Tobago in February 2001. When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin by a private security firm in Europe to come forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At  that time, my children and I did not have an idea where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the security firm to continue holding the safety deposit until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I was going through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered a Certificate  of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private security firm, and other documents relating to the safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US Dollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generated from cash payments from his business associates in the diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium. Though I knew my late husband was in the diamond business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my children, and we have decided to have this fund invested immediately in commercial and residential properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as any member of my family cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my political status, hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your most needed assistance in this regard. If you agree to render us your assistance, your role in this project will be to act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this transaction should be based on mutuality, my family's interest will be protected by a family associate, who is a lawyer(attorney) attached to the South African Embassy in the country where the security firm is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and I have informed him that I am locating one of my husband's business associates (you) to handle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to our decision if he found out  that I barely know you. For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20 % of the funds. I thank you in advance as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be representing us, and also give you his contact for both of you to communicate and proceed with the transaction.  He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a long lasting business relationship with you. As you may  understand, due to my sensitive position in the present government, it is not safe to communicate with me via phone or fax.  This is why I have communicated with you with my private email address, and I like us to keep this way, for the safety of this transaction. whether or not you are interested in assisting us  please let us know.This will enable us make  alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part. With warm regards, Mrs. S. Shabangu. --\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ZAF\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I am Jonathan Charles from the hospitality state ( Mississippi ), an army contractor attached to the US Military force in Iraq . The reason why I\u2019m contacting you is to explain my findings to you and to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes immensely to the actualization of my dream.   \\nI am attached to the US army for the sole purpose of reconstruction work in some parts of Iraq . As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconstructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some soldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a friend whom I have known for 12 years. On the 27th day of March 2007, at about 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where there is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded to a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guided by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick the metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one another which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of them.  Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and some boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollars and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes owned and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri. I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out of the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors. \\nI am now in desperate need of a \u201cReliable and Trustworthy\u201d person like you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot afford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as everything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my picture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with. I assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the alluvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within you so that my job would not be jeopardized.  My Sincere Regards,Jonathan Charles.You can contact me with my private email: jonathancharles01@yahoo.co.in\\n \\n_________________________________________________________________\\nNews, entertainment and everything you care about at Live.com.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM: DAVID PEDRO.\\nNO.1023 MATIMA STREET\\nFREE STATE, SOUTH AFRICA\\nTEL: +27.785709710\\nEMAIL: davpe@myway.com\\n\\nATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.\\n\\n\\nSTRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me\\npersonally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the\\nfirst SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.\\nI was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre\\nhere in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my\\nfather, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nThis amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the\\nfarms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem\\ncame when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new \\nLand Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed \\nbecause of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.\\nIt is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.\\n\\nI am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in \\nSouth Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since \\nboth countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African \\nForeign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker. \\nAs a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his \\nhands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept \\nto assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any\\naccount you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into \\npartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your \\ncountry. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have \\nalso mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the \\nprocess of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I \\nImplore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact  me on this  mail direct  email:davpe@myway.com\\n\\nAnd send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:\\n1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.\\n2) YOUR FULL NAME.\\n3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.\\nPLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY FATHER DIED, \\nFROM THE LINKS BELOW.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nTHANKS FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION\\nEMAIL: davpe@myway.com\\nDAVID PEDRO (FOR THE FAMILY)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhora tambi&eacute;n puedes acceder a tu correo Terra desde el m&oacute;vil.\\n\\nInf&oacute;rmate pinchando aqu&iacute;.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\\n\\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his \\ncontract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash \\n(for more information about this crash and person you can contact this \\nwebsite\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nSince we got this information about his death and on further \\ninvestigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further \\ninvestigationand discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit \\npaperwork in my Bank.\\n\\n This money is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this \\n\\nold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government \\nofficials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your \\nfull names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary \\ndocuments and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.\\nWe shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of \\n\\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in \\nany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\\n\\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, \\n  \\nPlease reply immediately via the private email address above.Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\nPlease reply through my private email address: a_dnanak_i@yahoo.com\\nAwaiting your urgent reply\\nRegards.\\nMr.Adnan A.K.Ismail \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

First and\\nforemost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a\\ntransaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality\\nand prompt access reposed on this medium.\\n\\nBe informed that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council\\n(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade\\nexhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek\\na confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described\\nHereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top\\nsecret because of the nature of this transaction.\\n\\nWithin the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an\\nExecutive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials, we\\nhave in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling TEN MILLION FIVE\\nHUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLAR, (10.5) which we want to transfer abroad with the\\nassistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the\\nsaid fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive\\nsuch funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South\\nAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore\\naccount hence your importance in the whole transaction.\\n\\nThis amount TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR ($10.5m)\\nrepresents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my\\nDepartment by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials\\nover-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid\\nto the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said\\namount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic\\nTransfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an\\napplication through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the\\ntransfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be\\nwilling to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your share\\nof the sum will be 25% of the $10.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation\\nand miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part\\nprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your\\narea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of\\nthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will\\nnot disappoint me.\\n\\nEndeavor to contact me through above e-mail address or the fax number\\nwhether or not you are interested in this deal.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        ATTN.DEAR,\\n\\nMy name is Mr Moni Millat  a member of Independent Committee of \\nEminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility \\nof finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss \\nindigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.\\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\nWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established.\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing \\ncredit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by \\nthe law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died \\ninterstate (living no wills).\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the Holland Or London, being a safe haven for funds and \\nwe can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.\\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your \\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim \\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you.\\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I \\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a \\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the Holland Or London, of which you \\nwill be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to \\nyour country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 \\npercent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO \\nRISK INVOLVED.\\nYou can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the \\ninternet at the following websites:\\n[URL]www.swissbankclaims.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]www.avotaynu.com[/URL]\\n[URL]www.icheic.org[/URL]\\n[URL]www.livingheirs.com[/URL]\\n[URL]www.wiesenthal.com[/URL]\\n\\nThe Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting \\nsubmission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.\\nI find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a \\ngreat opportunity for a life time of success without risks.\\nDue to security reasons, reply to my via email only.
