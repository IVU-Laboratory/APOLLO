Whoops. You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay. ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive. It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization, rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds, eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold (90%?). Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it? Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them). If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically, in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends. UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the LAN) are handled differently. For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available. For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion, which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts. ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped. >_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on > the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that. The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the \"speed limit to obey\" for every connection (based on policies and network conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may not be as \"tight\" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work. Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second.

Umm, don't get me wrong here, but I think you've been fed a less-than- accurate sales pitch. Let's ponder this for a minute. The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK flag set, right? ... [letting this sink in for a while] ... Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set. So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded? Whoops. Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed, but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written (dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available. But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic. Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate. So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of it is wrong. (Sorry.) What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong. And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.

You're missing the NEW state. The initial SYN packet will not match with either of the first two rules. It should match the third if it's inbound, though. > So far, I am unable to show that it's working correctly... I  > even tried  > logging all packets... >  > $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $INTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info > $IPTABLES -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -p tcp -j LOG --log-level info >  > But nothing show up in /var/log/messages or anywhere else for  > that matter.  You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain, introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.

That is, the attachment   is treated as one part.  The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are   sent to the server without parsing.  The other way to handle it is to treat it like   a regular mail, and break it down into parts.      There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right    now we chose not to break it down.  This might change in the future.   -chad On 26/07/02 02:24 +0200, Jrgen Thomsen wrote: ) I cannot determine if a verbatim forwarded message from Agent is handled ) correctly i.e. that a message with Content-Type: message/rfc822 does not ) include the original header lines improperly in the email body when reporting ) the spam.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Has anyone considered the fact that these occurrances appear to be increasing. I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but  I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing or not.  Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster which has over the years increased the distance between the rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks all impacting at different times, others may have this same type of design and could be in different stages of increasing distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter? So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

This is called \"pseudo-packages\" or \"meta-packages\" and Debian has been using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty packages. Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like them. For me it's more of an ugly \"hack\" than anything else, and I'd approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages. Also, you can trivially do \"apt-get install \", but removing all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.

[URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] CHOOSE YOUR TEAM [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] ================================================================= LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt) [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold. Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems. Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). \"Strong buy?\" Pfffffft. In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough. Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it. WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds. Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, \"Strong buy!\" [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at \"par,\" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below. [URL]http://www.lnksrv.com[/URL] As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. WARNING SIGN 5: \"IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER\" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. [URL]http://www.fool.com[/URL] As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out. HOMEWORK For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following: - Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four   quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,   staying about the same, or weakening? - Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past   four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing   slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures? - Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past   three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net   income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look   at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around   due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much   more indicative of real cash flow trends.) - If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center   and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know   whether your company has any debt, just type your company name   into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)   [URL]http://www.lnksrv.com[/URL] - Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its   current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is   there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario   already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,   this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's   still a question you should consider.)

These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with current events surrounding the companies you hold. Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems. Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). \"Strong buy?\" Pfffffft. In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. Warning sign 1: Slowing sales growth Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough. Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) Warning sign 2: Divergent sales and profit growth By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong.  Warning sign 3: Plummeting cash flowsIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it. Warning sign 4: Watch those bonds Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds. Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, \"Strong buy!\" I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at \"par,\" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below. As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. Warning sign 5: \"It just doesn't get any better\" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.

Yeah, well, I'm about to chuck the whole darned thing right now: the first upgrade to Gnome2 wiped out the possibility of changing preferences...exactly what got me outta Ximian before.  I understand Gnomehide has the same files, right?

The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax \\ncredit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees \\ncarry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 \\nbillion in goods and services, the audit found.\\n\\nIn one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and \\ngovernment-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, \\nthen spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to \\nsupply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their \\ntravel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.\\n\\n\"Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a \\nstrip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling \\nsuit?\" asked Dasbach. \"Americans who support a bigger defense budget, \\ntake note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, \\nreckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the \\nworthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even \\nimagine.\"\\n\\nOther spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury \\ncruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and \\narmchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.\\n \\nSome military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit \\nnoted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can \\nbe \"a useful tool for building good relations with a host country\" \\nsuch as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. \\n\\nNot surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found \"little evidence of \\ndocumented disciplinary action\" against those who misused the cards, \\nso taxpayers may end up paying the tab.\\n  \\n\"It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat \\nDefense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse \\ntaxpayers for every penny of improper spending,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard \\nagainst such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to \\nforce the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, \\ninstead of offending the taxpayer.\"\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.6.2\\n\\niQCVAwUBPUA6FdCSe1KnQG7RAQGAKwP/Zpfw0Uq3BPLnXXmnlWQ2aFFb1FSaj+nJ\\nQOMt9q4TBhiYJhIdgdd+uGxoubiPfvyIweSR1PjOdoFe8dYf2h/V4gNS9hSmkSgC\\n76RZVuitNf2DbEsaY8TtcUDLDC51m/jgxiGcgPkcyJ+0Wn11RRbktkVEefSNTaBz\\nM8ibVFiDPyI=\\n=9fYc\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Libertarian Party                                [URL]http://www.lp.org[/URL]\\n2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100                    voice: 202-333-0008\\nWashington DC 20037                                   fax: 202-333-0072\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFor subscription changes, please use the WWW form at: \\n[URL]http://www.lp.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I think that's simply because Sylpheed isn't a GNOME application, but a \"simple\" gtk+ one.

It does.  If anybody in the nmh world actually gets to the point of actually  implementing imap access, this will need to change, but until there exists an  environment where the direct access doesn't work, we're not going to take the  performance hit.
