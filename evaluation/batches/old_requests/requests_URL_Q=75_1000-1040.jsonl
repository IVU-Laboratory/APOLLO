It deserves to be forked, or even reforked.\\n\\n- Joe\\n\\n(BTW, RAID is the home-grown bug tracking system used at Microsoft.\\nSee e.g. [URL]http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil[/URL]\\nIt was a fine tool, better than any other I've had to use...)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bug Count Also Rises\\n\\n\\nby John Browne\\n(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)\\n\\nIn the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves \\nof the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles \\ndrove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then \\nlater brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.\\n\\nMany days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles \\nand drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.\\n\\nHernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came \\nto him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were \\nnot yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in \\nCafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you \\nthought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the \\nfloor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they \\nate at you.\\n\\nWhen Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. \"The RAID is huge \\nwith bugs,\" Hernando said. \"The bugs are infinite.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.\"\\n\\n\"Once you were great with the bugs,\" Hernando said. \"No one was \\ngreater,\" he said again. \"Even Prado.\"\\n\\n\"Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.\"\\n\\nHernando shrugged. \"Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in \\nChicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.\"\\n\\n\"Herb tea?\"\\n\\n\"It is true, my friend.\" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his \\noffice and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.\\n\\nMichaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for \\nawhile, then he asked Michaels, \"I need you to triage for me.\"\\n\\nMichaels looked down. \"I don't do that anymore,\" he said.\\n\\n\"This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.\"\\n\\n\"I'm finished with that,\" Michaels said again. \"I just want to live \\nquietly.\"\\n\\n\"Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only \\ndrink herb tea.\"\\n\\n\"Herb tea?\" Michaels said.\\n\\n\"It is true,\" he said sorrowfully.\\n\\nMichaels stood up. \"Then I will do it, my friend,\" he said formally. \"I \\nwill do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for \\nthe time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time \\nPrado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them \\nwith no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all \\nthe pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.\"\\n\\nTogether they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they \\nwalked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried \\nthe bodies back from the meetings.\\n\\n-- \\nThe Combatant State is your father and your mother, your only\\nprotector, the totality of your interests.

Not sure Motif is a good example, really. When Mozilla was going through its \"Let's Use Motif/Let's Not\" phase, Jamie Zawinski mentioned in passing that the installed base of Motif-bearing systems kicked the installed base of Linux-bearing systems into a huddled ball. Something, perhaps, to do with the fact that every Sun/Solaris box since version mumble shipped with it, plus every HP/UX box, and for all I know every other mainstream proprietary Linux. Motif was more a unifier across Unix subspecies than a differentiator. Now, filenames longer than 14 characters, maybe, or the options for ps (are we sysv or bsd?), or the whole /dev tree, or the libc implementation...

The\\nbenefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can\\nshare. (The up side is that the competition drives the different\\norganisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)\\n\\nSo unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available\\nfunctionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly\\nthe same.\\n\\nWhile I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,\\nthe binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,\\ndoing a \"man named\" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.\\nSo long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux\\ndistributions.\\n\\nI expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to\\nunderstand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions\\nappearing.

(thread changed slightly) [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        hey, AFAIK it isn't hard at all to create your own modified version of the redhat distro.  There's even a tarball[1] with this specifically in mind.  The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball. Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO. It *is* a good idea though.  I've been  wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all). I don't discount any other work like for  example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right. Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure  in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other),  no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places  such a suggestion would stumble. Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring  a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.

American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for  Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now. The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. \"In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,\" said the Journal. \"Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time.\" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United.  Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. \"The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions  to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,\" said the L.A.

These are companies that once referred to Linux as a \"bathtub of code\" (Sun) and \"a cancer\" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News. Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year. Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at  the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: \"Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.\" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft  will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- \"a place where  you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,\" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston:  \"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.\" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called \"Solinux.\" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon  Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. \"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,\" Poletti reported.

Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: \"Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.\" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- \"a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,\" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: \"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.\" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called \"Solinux.\" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. \"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,\" Poletti reported.

There was talk of this in the past.  Taking a regular distribution like Red Hat or Debian and tweaking it for Ireland - things like translations, ISP setups, default bookmarks. Never took off.

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!) However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary. But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is. You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001. And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a \"real\" company, etc). There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the source will always be free (or minimal cost). Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions.  Which is no problem - I don't see why that should be a problem for SuSE though - surely the  more the merrrier as far as they're concerned. > Are you clear on this point, now? Vide supra. > This is my second try.  Mighty white of you, old bean. >  One suspects that you actually understand >  perfectly, but just don't like it. One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't  understand was that SuSE had proprietary  extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence. I thought that the model for the likes of  SuSE was selling support and customisation,  rather than what I thought of as the core \"product\". I thought that the likes of Yast came under core - maybe it worked in the glory days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that they might want to make more money, but the way in which they have done it, seems to me, to be  be against the spirit of the GPL.   > You're further confused if you think the GNU  > GPL gives you the right to get covered software > for free.  It does not.   All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under the impression that for *_those_* all one needed was to pay for the media and not for the code itself? Ai-je tort? > It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received > a copy of the covered binary version, you have > rights to also receive the matching source code. My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for the cost of the media plus a token of one's appreciation (the latter being subject to agreement between the parties) - I was offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two and a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going rate is.

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can borrow them, but not  copy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against the spirit of the GPL though.   > Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your  > own distribution.

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say, trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears,  at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up proprietary and open stuff.   > What, you think that's too much work?

And I have no problem with people sticking trial editions along with GPL'ed stuff. Why you  can't pass those on though, is beyond me.
