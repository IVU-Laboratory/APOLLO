Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be \\nthe difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but \\nrelated, relaxation techniques including \"betagenics\", \\nhypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I \\nobsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / \\nG-Force Dyno-Staff.\\n\\nI have to say however that, having found this while looking for \\nsomething completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I \\nparticularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the \\nMindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.\\n\\nTo my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular \\nseem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some \\nreligion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very \\nirritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and \\ncontrast with our (my) modern mental models.\\n\\nI found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and \\njustify US/UN foreign policy and actions.\\n\\n[URL]http://mindprod.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://members.aol.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.mindprod.com[/URL]\\n(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)\\n\\nWe create the world we live in.\\nA loving person lives in a loving world,\\nA hostile person lives in a hostile world.\\nEveryone you meet is your mirror.\\n\\nYou make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence \\nas when you give offence.

VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \\nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \\nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \\nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \\nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \\nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \\neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \\nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \\nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \\nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \\nwrite more about what I learned. \\n\\n  \\n\\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \\nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \\nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \\ninfested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern. \\n\\n \\n\\n[IMG: [URL]http://www.joelonsoftware.com[/URL] (FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup)]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
