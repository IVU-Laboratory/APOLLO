Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor \\nof the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the \\nEnglish Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this \\nissue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I \\ntherefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if \\nyou decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nStephen Ayling. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black \"war veterans\" who in one of their attacks shot and killed him.\\n\\nIn case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any international news media like; [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] , [URL]http://www.cbc.ca[/URL]\\n\\nWell, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.\\n\\nI successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company's account.\\n\\nPlease, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no risk is involved.\\n\\nIn dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.\\n\\nI will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every details of myself as well as that of the transaction.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nNopparat Sujaritpinij\\nnopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com\\n\\n\\n \\n  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I am Mr. PRINCE WILL NKOMO , the son of late Mr. HARRY NKOMO, one of the major victims in the on going crisis in Zimbabwe. You might have heard or read about it, you can visit [URL]www.cnn.com[/URL]\\\\zimbabwe. I obtained your contact privately and after due consideration and prayers decided to contact you for assistance to transfer and invest our family fund.\\n\\nMy country Zimbabwe is in real war with no end sight, the president Mr. Robert Mugabe  introduced a new land reform act meant to deprive and relocate all the major farms in Zimbabwe, this now resulted in the Zimbabwe war veterans and black mob killing, looting and displacing the entire farm in Zimbabwe, many has been killed and my father was one of the major  victims, as we own one of the biggest farm in our country.\\n\\nShortly before his death, he took to South Africa with my mother to deposit the sum of US$20,000,000.00(TWENTY  MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) into a security and finance company in South Africa. It was deposited as a family valuables to avoid attention and high demurrage payment because this money was actually for the building of an ultra modern farms with all the machineries such as pipe-born water, electricity chemicals etc. only that he did not survive to realize this, May His Gentle Soul Rest In Peace.\\n\\nNow faced with this situation, we decided to exile to South Africa with the rest of the family where we have awaited for things to cool down and have successful claims to the funds .I have in my mother's possession all the necessary documents as regards to the deposit of this fund.\\n\\nWe had planned to invest this money in South Africa, but because of our status as asylum seekers, the financial laws in South Africa does not allow asylum seekers any investment and financial rights not even to operate a bank accounts in the country until asylum is approved which still pending, more so the nearness of South Africa and my country is not safe for us without a reliable bank account into which we can transfer this money. \\n\\nDo understand to provide a suitable account to transfer this fund for our resettlement and investments. Can you handle this fund without any problem in your country, if so do contact me on my telephone no as soon as possible for further arrangement as regards to our working plans.\\n\\nThanks and God bless as I await your sincerely response.\\n\\nMr  PRINCE WILL NKOMO\\n(FOR THE FAMILY).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

As I am\\n interested in your kind of business and wishing to invest in your country.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian military Head of State.\\n General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 still in office due\\nto\\n\\na\\n protracted illness.\\n\\nI believe you must be aware of the recent face-off between my family and the\\n\\n\\n present Civilian Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who wants all my\\n\\n\\n Late husbands foreign bank accounts and assets confiscated because of the\\n monetary excesses of my la\\n\\n\\nte husbands\\nMilitary regime.\\n\\nCurrently, within my reach is the sum of twenty-three Million seven Hundred\\n\\n\\n thousand United States Dollars (US$ 23,700,000.00) cash, which I intend to\\n\\nuse\\n for investment purposes especially in your country. This huge sum of money\\n\\n\\n came\\n as result of a pay\\n\\n\\nback contract\\ndeal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multi\\nbillion\\n\\n\\n Dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant/complex. The Russian partners had since\\nreturned\\n\\n\\n my\\n husband's share of US$23.7Million after his death and lodged it with a\\n security\\n firm.\\n\\nRight now the new Civilian Government have revoked all our licenses that\\nallows\\n\\n\\n us to own financial and oil companies and has frozen some of my late\\nhusbands\\n\\n\\n bank account in Switzerland and America.\\n\\nIn view of these I acted very fast to withdraw this US$23.7M from the\\nsecurity\\n\\n\\n company's vault well preserved and packaged in {1}trunk box and lodged in a\\n\\n\\n private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record ever\\nexisted\\n\\n\\n concerning the money\\n\\n\\nneither is the money traceable by the Government because there is no\\ndocuments\\n\\n\\n showing that we received the money from the Russians.\\n\\nHowever, due to the current situation in the country concerning the present\\n\\n\\n civilian Government hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite\\n\\n\\n impossible for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek\\n\\n\\n your\\n assistance in moving t\\n\\n\\nhis family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending my\\narrival\\n\\n\\n in\\n your country for investment purposes.\\n\\nOn your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collect\\nthis\\n\\n\\n deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf.

You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:([URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] and my only daughter died in BOMB ATTACK LONDON.\\n\\nMy late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.\\n\\nThis mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently\\nrelocate to Africa where I live presently.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi,\\n\\nI'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \\nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \\n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou've probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt's people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.\\n\\nIf you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt's that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \\nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.

There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the \\nimmediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to \\nthe bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank \\nname, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for \\neasy and effective communication and location where in the money will be \\nremitted .\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application.

THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL \\nREQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN \\nWITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN \\nACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS \\nREQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE \\nCORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM \\nTO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.\\n\\n\\nI WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON \\nSMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE \\nTOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF \\nEXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND \\nINTERNET BILLS, WHILE 50% WILL BE FOR ME.
