[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Foreword\\n\\nAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in \"Ghetto America,\" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the \"Black Generation X\". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of \"Generation X\". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed \"Baby Boomers\", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled \"Generation X\", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: \\n \\n \"We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called \"Xer's\" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.\"\\n\"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.\" \\n\\nThis definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these \"similarities\" speak primarily to only \"white\" issues and concerns. For instance, \"they\" say \"we\" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America \"we\" could only depend on one our mothers! \"They\" also say, \" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,\" and \" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever.\" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all \"we\" have time for. \\nI have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the \"Black\" from \"Generation X\" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.\\nThere are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. \"White America\" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled \"Ethnic Notions.\" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching \"Roger & Me,\" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex\\n posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.\\nRegarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.\\n Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. \\nWhat originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with \"Huxtable?like\" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or \"working class\" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the \"Huxtable?like\" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. \\nThe majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our \"dirty laundry\". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. \\nI recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. \\nThe purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that \"black male and female generation X\" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)\\nRegarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.\\nIn my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. \\nThinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our \"male rapper\" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. \"The Big Tymers\", a popular rap duo, have a song called \"I'm Still Fly\", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (\"Fly\" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:\\n\\n\"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci\\nSuit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's\\nspent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.\"\\n\\nWorse yet, in the song \"Grinding\", the popular duo \"Eclipse\" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term \"grinding\" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are \"grindingyou know what I keep in the lining\" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and\\n\\n\"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man\\nI bake them cakes as fast as I can\\nand you can tell cause of how my bread stack up\\nand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup\"\\n\\nIn this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term \"cake\" or sometimes \"pie\") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. \\nThe negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al\\n luded too. \\nI have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of \"us\" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. \\nAdditionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being \"African?Americans\", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as \"Black\", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as \"Niggas,\" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with \"Nigger\". The term \"nigga\" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term \"My Nigga\") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as \"Ghetto\", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the\\n  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. \\nMy commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.\\nIn the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by \"White America\". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno\\n wledging that this absence is by design. \\nThere are other \"core\" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not \"thugged out\". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the \"thug,\" and \"drug dealer\" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. \\nThese issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that \"confused mentality\" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American \"ghetto\" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that \"ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into \"Black America\".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that \"backward thinking\" is the main \\n cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.\\n*************************************************************\\n To read More go to [URL]www.blackrealitypublishing.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\\nwith \"unsubscribe freebsd-ports\" in the body of the message\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

This is by virtue of its nature\\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. \\nThough I know that a transaction of this magnitude\\nwill make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am\\nassuring you that all will be well at the end of the\\nday. \\n\\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\\ndecided it is best using the email. \\n\\nLet me start by first introducing myself properly to\\nyou. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the\\nMinistry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man\\ntender board appointed by the Government of the\\nFederal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to\\nindividuals and companies and to approve such contract\\npayments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The\\nduties of the committee also include evaluation,\\nvetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign\\nand local contractors in the ministry.\\n\\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \\n\\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\\nrural electrification projects. \\n\\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\\nintention that the committee will share the excess\\nwhen the payments are approved. \\n\\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\\nand contractors concerned which executed the\\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\\nourselves.\\n\\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\\nhandicapped in this circumstances as the civil service\\ncode of conduct, does not allow us to operate\\noff-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole\\ntransaction is highly needed . \\n\\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \\n\\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not\\nwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.\\n\\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\\ncases of business associates running away with funds\\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\\nbe based completely on the following: \\n\\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\\ndiligence. \\n\\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \\n\\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \\n\\n(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough\\ninformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. \\n\\nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\\nrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten\\nBank working days from the date of receipt of the\\nnecessary information and requirement from you. \\n\\nEndeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter\\nusing my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email\\naddress and I will bring you into the complete picture\\nof this transaction when I have heard from you. \\n\\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated as we\\nare already behind schedule for this financial\\nquarter. \\n\\nThank you and God bless. \\n\\nYours faithfully, \\n\\nDr. Osaro Ame \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nYahoo!

My name is IDRIS UMAR a merchant in\\nDubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has\\ndefiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a\\nfew months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly\\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even\\nmyself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was\\nalways hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the\\nonly thing I cared for.\\n\\nBut now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than\\njust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when\\nGod gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a\\ndifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have\\nwilled and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and\\nextended family members as well as a few close friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to\\ngive alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last\\ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity\\norganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked\\nmembers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money\\nwhich I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they\\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them\\nanymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of\\neighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a\\nfinance/Security\\nCompany abroad.\\n\\nI will want you to help me collect this\\ndeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.\\n\\n\\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\\n\\nGod be with you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir, \\n  \\nI am sure you will be surprised at this letter that i am sending to you as we have never met before. But let me introduce myself to you. I am Mr. John Taylor, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]  \\n  \\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. \\n  \\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand\\nas next of kin to a foreigner. \\n  \\nIn appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. \\n  \\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email for further directives. \\n  \\nYours Faithfully, \\nMr. John Taylor.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the US$55 Million  from the security company's \\nvault well packaged in trunk boxes and deposited it in a privately erected security safe. I have since declared the  Security Company bankrupt and re-locate the money to another security Firm in nearby country Ghana due to its peaceful atmosphere. No record ever existed concerning the money neither the money traceable by the Government nor any document showing that we received the money from Russian partner. I seek your assistance to move the money out of from Ghana to your country.I am presently taken my asylum in Ghana until the tranfer of the money to your account is over.\\n \\nOn your reply, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in details about this transaction.

I sent you a letter by post office sometime ago informing you of our \\nplan to transfer the sum of US$20.5million (Twenty\\nmillion, Five hundred thousand US Dollars only) to your account.\\n\\n I have been waiting to hear from you,but up till now, nothing has been \\nheard from you hence this particular message. In any case, I guess that \\nyou may not have received the letter after all due to the shortcomings \\nof our postal system. I want you to know that this fund originated from \\nan Over-invoiced contract sum which was awarded to a foreign firm in \\n1999.\\n\\n I and my three (3)other colleagues in the tender Board purposely \\ninflated the actual cost of the contract to the tune of US$20.5Million. \\nHowever, the original contractor has fully executed the contract, the \\nproject commissioned and the contractor paid his actual contract worth, \\nleaving behind the over-invoiced sum. So, itis based on this that we \\nnow want you / your company to come forward to claim this sum on our \\nbehalf. We are Civil Servants, and we are not allowed to operate \\nforeign account while still in office, so you are therefore to act as \\none who had executed a contract worth the sum of US$20.5million for my \\nDepartment and you now want your payment.This deal is 100% risk free. \\nWe \\nare perfectly in charged and had worked out modalities that would \\nguarantee a hitch free transfer of this fund to your account. \\n\\nWe have also mapped out 30% of the total sum for you for your help and \\nassistance while the remaining is for me and my colleagues. If you are \\ninterested in the proposal, and you are a trustworthy person who would \\nnot sit on this money if it is transferred to your account,kindly \\nindicate by contacting me through my private telephone/fax numbers,or \\nvia my E-mail.You can as well send your bank account details for this \\ntransfer. This deal must be kept absolutely confidential till we \\nsucceed. \\n\\nThank you as we look forward to your anticipated co-operation. NOTE \\n=After a successful transfer, 30% for you, 60% for us, 10% mapped out \\nto settle expenses incurred by both parties in the process oftransfer.\\n\\nWe will also visit you immedaitely we conclude this transaction to \\ncollect and invest our shares of the total sum into any viable business \\nyou may advise us in your country.

I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.\\n \\nIn my Bank we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8 MILLION in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.\\n\\n[URL]http://seattlepi.nwsource.com[/URL] \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n \\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n \\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n \\nWe agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our Watchword in this transaction.\\n \\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard.\\n\\nPlease note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. In your response, include the following information.\\n \\n{1}Your full name and address\\n{2}Your telephone/Mobile number and fax number\\n{3} Your business name\\n{4} Age and status.\\n \\nBest regards\\n \\nMR IAN REED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. \\n\\nWhats more, there are NO competitors for the Companys method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with\\nMajor Casinos Globally.    \\n \\nMichael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations.  The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons. A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at [URL]http://www.gamingobserver.com[/URL]\\n \\ni2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. \\n\\nFACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corps common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! \\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY\\n\\n     i2corp   \\nOTCBB Symbol                  (ITOO)\\nRecent Price     \t          .05 - .08\\n52-Week Hi-Lo \t          .05 - .48\\nShort Term Target Price:     .60\\n\\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
