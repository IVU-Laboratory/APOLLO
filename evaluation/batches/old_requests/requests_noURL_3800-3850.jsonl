In \\nmy department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15m dollars (Fifteen  \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with \\nhis entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about \\nthe crash you can visit this site: \\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \\nproposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation \\nto the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is \\ncoming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as \\nunclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \\nof a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the \\nbusiness and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the \\nimmediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the \\nbank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application \\nthat i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private \\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location \\nwhere in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application . I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction \\nis hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all \\nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me\\nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\nYours Faithfully,\\n1. NAME IN FULL:................................\\n2.

Dear Friend, I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa . In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board. Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund. The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above. To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately.

I am James DeSouza, a Regional Director with NATIONAL TRUST SECURITY COMPANY S.A.R.L with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited a huge sum \\nof amount, US$4.5million(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our Company. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999\\nin U.S.A. Confirmable from the below website:([URL]www.cnn.com[/URL] but, since then we have not had any body to come for the claims as the next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the Company. \\n\\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past two years plus, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now solicit for your assistance to present \\nyou as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled b\\ny me and every loop holes sealed off.\\n\\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences. \\n\\nBelieving to hear from you soonest. \\n\\nKind regards,\\nJames DeSouza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Good Day,\\n\\nWith warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\\n\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. \\n\\nMy Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!\\nnd) to seek for political asylum.\\n\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. \\n\\nPresident Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.\\n\\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\\n\\nYour role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.

CHEUNG PUI\\n\\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\\n\\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\\n\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\n\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui \\n\\ndirector of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I \\n\\nhave an urgent business suggestion for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nI honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much \\n\\nembarrassment by contacting you through this means for \\n\\na transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to \\n\\nconfidentiality and prompt access reposed on this \\n\\nmedium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands \\n\\nnow,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, \\n\\nand it is imperative for me to know your opinion\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi \\n\\nBassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business \\n\\nman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar \\n\\nmonths, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several \\n\\nnotice was sent to him, even during the war early this \\n\\nyear. Again after the war  another notification was \\n\\nsent and still no response came from him. We later \\n\\nfind out that the Major and his family had been killed \\n\\nduring the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered \\n\\nthat Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin \\n\\nin his official papers including the paper work of his \\n\\nbank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time \\n\\nhe was at my office that no one except me knew of his \\n\\ndeposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five \\n\\nHundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying \\n\\nin my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim \\n\\nit. What bothers me most is that according to the laws \\n\\nof my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will \\n\\nrevert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if \\n\\nnobody applies to claim the funds. \\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I \\n\\nwill like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of \\n\\nkin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to \\n\\nreceive his funds. \\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned \\n\\nout so that we shall come out successful. I have \\n\\ncontacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary \\n\\ndocument that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , \\n\\nall that is required from you at this stage is for you \\n\\nto provide me with your Full Names and Address so that \\n\\nthe attorney can commence his job. After you have been \\n\\nmade the next of kin, the attorney will also file in \\n\\nfor claims on your behalf and secure the necessary \\n\\napproval and letter of probate in your favor for the \\n\\nmove of the funds to an account that will be provided \\n\\nby you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we \\n\\nare going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney \\n\\nwill prepare all the necessary documents. Please \\n\\nendeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters \\n\\nconcerning thisissue.Once the funds have been \\n\\ntransferred to your nominated bank account we shall \\n\\nshare in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% \\n\\nfor any expenses incure during the transaction. Should \\n\\nyou be interested please send me your full names and \\n\\ncurrent residential address and I will prefer you to \\n\\nreach me via my private box, \\n\\n\\n\\n{che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour earliest response to this letter will be \\n\\nappreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\n\\n\\nMr Cheung Pui.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail envoy par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke\\n\\n- [URL]http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$78M, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing to you.\\n\\nMy name is Bartholomew mutie, I am the personal assistance to the former President of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$78M, on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in\\nNigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later, but resently he has just been arrested and taken away. you can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006. [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n\\nAll the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.\\n\\nMy questions are:-\\n 1. Can you handle this project?\\n 2. Can I give you this trust?\\n 3. can you keep this business as very confidential?\\n 4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your commission?\\n\\nREPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:\\nConsider this and reply as soon as possible to (my private email address) mutiebath@infinito.it, so i can give you more clear explanations details and information about this transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and fax number for easy reach. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. Please i need you to send me your telephone number so i can give you a call immediately for more discusion. As soon as I get your positive response, I will send you more information to you.\\n\\nBest regard\\n\\nMr. Bartholomew mutie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Of course it does. You most likely have\\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\\n\\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old\\nwoman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my\\nhusband earns in a year\".\\n\\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\\nactually finding it in the closet.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \\n\"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\\ncomputer in his bedroom.\\n\\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever\\n15-year-old.\\n\\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\\nthe top of the list.\\n\\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and\\nreally did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.\\n\\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\\n\\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the\\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".  Over\\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"  The\\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\\ncloset, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike\\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \\nfifties and hundreds.\\n\\n\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\\nbank down the street (laughs).\"  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news \\n\\nteam examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was\\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\\n\\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\\n\"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter\\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \\nfive-dollar fee.\\n\\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading.

Before you\\nsay \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS\\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\\nTHAN EVER.\\n\\n\\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.\\n\\nIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \\napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\".\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time \\nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\\nanything.\" More testimonials later but first,\\n\\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\\n\\n++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE \\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

To assist you with marketing\\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's\\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\n\\n\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\\norders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:\\n1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......\\nGrand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment\\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\\nmailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on \\nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just\\nthat, and more!\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\\nFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\\neasily get a larger response.\\n\\n\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as\\nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\\nReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all\\norders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\\nreceive the report.\\n\\n=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\\nthe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \\nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\\n\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\\n\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\nR.

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different\\nreport.

My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an\\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \\n\"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\\npopulation and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody\\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \\n\"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on\\nme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45\\ndays she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.\\nI have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".\\n\\nMitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that\\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\\nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back\". \"I was\\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live.

I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. \\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \\n\\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking\\ntreasury as unclaimed funds.\\n\\nWe agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction.\\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.\\nDo call me and lets discuss more on this. \\n\\nBest regards\\nFehmi Mehmet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\\n- [URL]http://politiks.us[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Until his demise, he held\\nsensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one of\\nthe office he held , was the position of the personal assistant\\nto the U.N secretary general, Koffi Annan. His death was a shock\\nto the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreign\\naccounts in our department which I mannage myself due to his\\nposition in the country. Such operations of accounts is called\\n\"Private Banking\" where the deposits will only be known to the\\nowner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge.\\n\\nNormally,65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned into\\nthe Federal Government account and 30%, 5% given to the family\\nand bank respectively.  This is what the banking law and policy\\nof my country states, When this is achieved i.e transfer of the\\nFederal Government account part, the people at the corridors of\\npower withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issues\\nbut make use of theseFunds for their personal and family use.\\nThis is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of the\\naccount and the family of the deceased. So I released the code of\\nthe account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit.\\nSince the code of the account is in between me and the deceased\\nthe fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot make\\nwithdrawals from this account myself and that is where you come\\nin.\\n\\nAll you need to do for this transaction is to follow the\\nprocedure binding this contract together and I guarantee you\\nit&#8217;s risk free.

During the \\ncourse of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) \\nfloating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as \\nfrom 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after \\ngoing through some old files in the records I discovered that \\nthe owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 \\nby plane crash, hence the money is floating.\\n\\nAfter due verification I noticed that no other person knows \\nabout this account except his wife who was also invovled in the \\ncrash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my \\ninvestigation proved to me as well that until his death he was \\nthe Director GOLD ARK [SARL]\\n \\nSince our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about \\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come \\nforward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies \\nbut up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin \\nor relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and \\nother officials in my department now decided to make this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the \\nnext of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we \\ndon't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed \\nBill.\\n \\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used \\nas the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And \\nthe country law here does not allow such money to stay more \\nthan Five years, for the money will be recalled to the \\ngovernment treasury as unclaimed after this period.\\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the \\napplication form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this business is \\nhitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all \\nmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five \\nbanking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the \\ndeceased.\\n \\nWhen you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail \\nsignifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers \\nfor quick communication.

My question is can the current software on my machine  use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how  much software is available for Linux.

Hello Nicety, I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, [URL]http://www.wonderpaint.com[/URL],   when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory  when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the  approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems,  I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much  negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer  for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's  favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I  have to make it do anything useful.  If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE  download called FreeMem which you can get here; [URL]http://www.meikel.com[/URL] This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you  also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released.  This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be  running at peak performance all the time and much easier than  constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these  little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to  search for. HTH.

Comments on Site #141:  [URL]http://www.floridarental.co.uk[/URL] Carol Hall carol@floridarental.co.uk ~~~~ Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to make your front page navigation a little less confusing? The \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark this page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not enough information on your openning page. ~~~~ I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site. 1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the animation and red text on the yellow background, missing the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more details to this important introduction. Instead of using the 'click here' button, just have a text link following directly after the introduction. 2. On the second page, have all your links the same color, and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill. 3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed menu and the pages are all untitled. I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you want the best site you can have and I think these changes will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the site you have the information organized and complete. I even wanted to come and stay! ~~~~ The animations make this site look amateurish from the beginning.  The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve this site. ~~~~ I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should have been up by the text and that is where I should go. On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that, the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page. The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good. Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten that far. ~~~~ This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich. Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste, but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that form a background for some images. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441, WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of what is going on in windows.\u00a0 He suggests Linux.

Hello Nicety, I\u00a0 have to agree with Jim Shofstall, [URL]http://www.wonderpaint.com[/URL], when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441: <snip> \u00a0One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.\u00a0 When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, </snip> I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I have to make it do anything useful. If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE download called FreeMem which you can get here; [URL]http://www.meikel.com[/URL] This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be running at peak performance all the time and much easier than constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to search for. HTH.\u00a0 Tony. \t\t______________________________________________________ >>>>>> WEBSITE SHOWCASES <<<<<< Examine carefully - those with email addresses included WILL trade links with you, you are encouraged to contact them.
