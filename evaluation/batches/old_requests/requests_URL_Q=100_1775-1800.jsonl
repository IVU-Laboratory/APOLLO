I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that \\nthe run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short \\nloop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 \\nbug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds \\nthem, can you please let me know? Thank you. \\n\\nI ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my \\noff-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of \\nrunners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner \\nsmiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another \\nrunner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative \\nyears. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a \\nrunner. \\n\\nBecoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves \\nrunning. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important \\npart. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, \\nrun around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day \\nyou'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can \\nrun a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, \\nthen get invigorated and run another mile. \\n\\nAnd then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and \\nyou run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and \\nthat the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running \\nthing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and \\nyou run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is \\nimportant too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and \\nrun. \\n\\nThere's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a \\nrunner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you \\nshould really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to \\nmaximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't \\nworry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just \\nanother fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
