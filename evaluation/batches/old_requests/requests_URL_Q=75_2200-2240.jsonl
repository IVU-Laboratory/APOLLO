[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi,\\n\\nI'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \\nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \\n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou've probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt's people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.\\n\\nIf you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt's that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \\nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \\nDon't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step \\nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\\nbuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating \\norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.\\n\\nOkay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?\\n\\nNo problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot\\nproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay\\nstarting an Internet business because they have \\nnothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  \\nAfter reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete \\nproduct line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE \\nnot to get started! I will get you up-and-running within \\nseven days. In fact ...\\n\\nI personally guarantee that you will start your own \\nbulk email campaign less than a week after reading \\nthe Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number \\nto reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; \\nwhere else will you find that level of service?!\\n\\nI will also include a step-by-step guide to starting \\nyour very first email campaign called \"Seven Days to \\nBulk Email Success\".  This seperate guide contains a daily \\nroutine for you to follow with specific, exact \\ninstructions on how to get started.  On day one, for \\nexample, I teach you where to find a product to sell. \\nThe next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing \\nlist.  On the seventh day, you just click send!

MABEL NDLOVU,the wife of\\nLate DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recently\\nmurdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe.\\nI got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADE\\nCENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to write\\nyou.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe rich\\nfamers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of\\nthe ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for his\\nalleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean\\nopposition party,controlled by the white minority.\\nBefore his death,he had taken me to to deposite the\\nsum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a security\\nand finance company as if he knew the looming danger in\\nZimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as\\ngemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security\\ncompany. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm\\nmachinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm in\\nlesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president\\nRobert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affected\\nthe rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned the\\nmodusoperand\"adopted by the government. This\\nresulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war\\nveterans and some political thugs presently,more\\nthan SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads of\\ngovernment from the west,especially The Great Britain and The\\nUnited states of America have voice their condemnation of\\nMUGABE'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)has\\ncontinuously supported MUGABE'S new land reform\\nAct.It is against this background that I and my Children who are\\ncurrently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC but\\ncurrently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICAN\\nCOUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband's money into\\na foreign\\naccount. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my late\\nhusband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a\\ngenuine foreign account where this money could be\\ntransfer without theknowledge of my country's\\ngovernment who are tatically freezing our\\nfamilieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The South\\nAfrica government seems to be playing along with\\nthem. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount of\\nmoney in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encountering\\nthe same experience in future since both countries have almost\\nthe same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financial\\nforeign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence\\nI am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whom\\nI must entrust my future and that of my family on his\\nhands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100%\\nRISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we are\\nwilling to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70%\\nfor me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for all\\nexpenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATE\\nbased on your advice and I would also receive assurance that you\\nwould'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personal\\nor company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please do\\nsend me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .\\nYou should know that this business is highly confidential and shall\\nbe kept within you alone.I hope to hear from you soon\\non the  email address bellow.\\n\\n(mabel45@ureach.com)\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nMRS MABEL NDLOVU.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at - [URL]http://yoursitenamehere.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"SGP\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

In order to avert this negative \\ndevelopment, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your \\npermission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so \\nthat the fund will be released and paid into your account as the \\nbeneficiary.s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of \\nkin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson.\\n\\nIn fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in \\nthis country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during \\nthe time of transfer since we still work in this bank,this is the actual \\nreason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us \\nforward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing \\nbank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately\\nto receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose.\\n\\nOn smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as \\ngratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me \\nand my partners.\\n\\nWhat I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I \\nhave in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully \\naccomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk \\nfree.\\n\\nFurther Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your \\npositive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible \\nstating your wish.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Some opportunities only come around every 30 years or so. This is one of those. Why? Because interest rates are definitely rising. Have you locked in the lowest rate (in THREE DECADES yet!) for your present mortgage? Rates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades. They may well never be this low again--ever. If you haven't taken this opportunity to secure the best possible rate on your home loan, you're simply letting money slip through your fingers. At a few special times, it is SO easy to save \"big bucks\"...and this is one of those times. Why continue to pay more than is necessary and continue to let future savings slip away?    We're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a broker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest possible rate and the best possible deal but only if you act NOW.   There is no charge, cost or obligation to see if this opportunity meets your needs. You can easily determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and exactly why, because we provide only \"easy to understand\" quotes (in \"layman's terms\", in other words).   We offer primary and secondary home loans and we will be happy to show you in \"black and white\" why your existing loan is the best for you or why you should replace it. Of course, there's no cost to you at all to share your time with us. None.  Take 2 minutes and use the link below that works best for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll show you how you can save you and your family \"big bucks\" today. This is a once-every-30-years opportunity. So don't delay and \"miss the boat\". Act now.

Castro, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Capital trust bank Benin, Cotonou, Republic of Benin West Africa, and also a special account officer of Mr. Peter Lund,European. He was a seasoned contractor with Benin Cement Company, Cotonou, who unfortunately died in a plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on 25th December, 2003.You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:\\n \\n1.[URL]www.guardian.co.uk[/URL],1280,-3555201,00.html\\n2.[URL]www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nBefore his death on the 25th December 2003, Mr.Lund has a fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person know about this account or have any information relating to this account. The account has no beneficiary nor next-of-kin other than him, My investigation reveal that his supposed next-of-kin died along with him in the crash. Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.\\n\\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you.I'm contacting you to assist in remittance of a dormant fund as the next of kin left behind by Mr.Lund so as not to allow the bank confiscate or declare the funds unserviceable in the account according to Benin Republic financial law on unclaimed bills which the government usually map out for the purchase of ammunitions which are the major course of conflicts in the west of  Africa. Consequently, I'm seeking your consent to present you as the next-of-kin to the deceased customer so that the outstanding fixed deposit (US$24.1M) will be remitted into any designated account of yours to be shared by both of us in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% for you.\\n\\nI have all necessary legal documents to back up this claim. All that is required of you is absolute honesty, total commitment, co-operation & absolute confidentiality. Be rest-assured that this transaction will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect both parties from breach of the law and it is 100% risk free and attracts no authorities and every information you will require as the next of kin will be forwarded to you after your final acceptance to help me champion this deal. If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email your following information to me.\\n\\na. Full Name(s)\\n\\nb. Direct phone & fax number(s)\\n\\nc. Your personal email and your complete home address.\\n\\nThank you for your cooperation until I read from you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Westpac Banking Corporation, 63 St. Mary Axe London EC3A 8LE  I am Mr.kelly wood ,Department of Foreign Operations, Westpac Banking Corporation London,an affiliate of Global Funds Management.  On January 6th 2001, one Mr. Joseph Huber, an American National,a consultant/contractor with Gardiner & Theobald,a leading firm of project and cost management consultants, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit, valued at ?6,500,000.00 (Twenty-six Million, Five Hundred Thousand Pounds) for twelve calender months in my Bank Branch.Upon Maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (Gardiner & Theobald) that Mr. Joseph Huber was aboard the, American Airlines Flight 587 which crashed into a residential area near John F. Kennedy International Airport on November 12,2001.[URL]www.cnn.com[/URL]  After investigation, it was discovered that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin proved fruitless. On further investigation, it was discovered that Late Mr.Joseph Huber did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paper work here at the Bank. The total sum, ?6,500,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. In accordance with the Federal banking Laws and constitution,the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds.  Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to stand in as the next of kin to late Mr. Joseph Huber so that you and I can benefit from the fruits of this man's labour. Upon acceptance of this proposal, I shall give detailed information on how this deal would be carried out.We shall employ the services of a solicitor for the drafting of the LAST WILL & TESTAMENT of Late Mr.Joseph Huber and to obtainallother relevant papers in your name for the necessary documentation for payment approval in my bank headquarters in your favour.  The money will be shared in the ratio:Sixty percent for me, thirty five percent for you and five percent for any arising contigencies during the course of this transaction.  I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law as I will use my position in the bank to secure approvals and guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. Please be informed that your utmost confidentiality is required. If this interests you, please reply me immediately via the private email address kelly_wood7@excite.com  and please include your private telephone number for voice contact and fax number so I can provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me.\\nThe reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will facilitate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.Upon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have been finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business.Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.Regards, Mr Adams   Swll\\nAfrican Development BankOuagadougou, Burkina Faso. \\n \\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFind a local pizza place, movie theater, and more\u2026.then map the best route!\\n[URL]http://maps.live.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. \\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. \\n\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 50,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills). \\n\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the U.A.E Dubia, being a tax free country, where we can safely withdrew the funds and we can share the funds and use  it for investment of our choice. \\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your \\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim \\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you. \\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I \\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a \\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the U.A.E Bank in Dubia, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of  your choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount.
