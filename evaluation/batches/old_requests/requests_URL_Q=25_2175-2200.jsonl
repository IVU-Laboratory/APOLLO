Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\\n\\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his \\ncontract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash \\n(for more information about this crash and person you can contact this \\nwebsite\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nSince we got this information about his death and on further \\ninvestigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further \\ninvestigationand discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit \\npaperwork in my Bank.\\n\\n This money is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this \\n\\nold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government \\nofficials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your \\nfull names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary \\ndocuments and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.\\nWe shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of \\n\\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in \\nany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\\n\\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested, \\n  \\nPlease reply immediately via the private email address above.Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\nPlease reply through my private email address: a_dnanak_i@yahoo.com\\nAwaiting your urgent reply\\nRegards.\\nMr.Adnan A.K.Ismail \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

First and\\nforemost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a\\ntransaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality\\nand prompt access reposed on this medium.\\n\\nBe informed that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council\\n(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade\\nexhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

If you are not, it will\\nenable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to\\nassure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment\\nof this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and\\nguarantee that our share will be secured. And please remember to treat this\\nas very confidential because, we will not comprehend with any form of\\nexposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once\\nagain that, time is of the essence in this business.\\n\\nI wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nBONGIES ZULU\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nGet news headlines and download FREE stuff - visit MSN South Africa! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        ATTN.DEAR,\\n\\nMy name is Mr Moni Millat  a member of Independent Committee of \\nEminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility \\nof finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss \\nindigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.\\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\nWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established.\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing \\ncredit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by \\nthe law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died \\ninterstate (living no wills).\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the Holland Or London, being a safe haven for funds and \\nwe can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.\\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your \\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim \\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you.\\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I \\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a \\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the Holland Or London, of which you \\nwill be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to \\nyour country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 \\npercent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount.

If you've been like me, you've been trying\\ntrying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel\\n- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise \\nequipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose\\neither. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less\\nweight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Oh geez, not another\\nmiracle diet pill!\" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but \\nmy sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, \\nso I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing \\nto lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was\\nthe best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,\\nas I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds\\nto 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet\\nat all.

I know how you feel\\n- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is\\na vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got\\nto stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies\\nanywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!\\nWell, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Gosh darn, not another\\ncheap knockoff printer cartridge!\" Like you, I was very \\nskeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate\\nsaid it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. \\nSo I tried it. I mean, there was nothing to lose because they\\noffer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty\\non all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!\\nLet me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\\nPeriod. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,\\nI've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies\\nto Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or\\nservice that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,\\nthe service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since \\nI started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement\\nwithin 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!\\n\\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer\\nand got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.
