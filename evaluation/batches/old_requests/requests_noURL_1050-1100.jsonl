In recent years,\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold, studies show. \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \\n\\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and I'm disbanding it.\" \\n\\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\\n\"There's this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it's better that\\nthey end.\" \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\\nas more important. \\n\\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad. \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me.\" \\n\\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \\n\\n\"Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we're starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics.\" \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior.\" \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It's\\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend's\\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\\nLerner's patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They'll\\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\\nshe finds out.\" \\n\\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and\\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\\nisn't,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one. \\n\\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover there's something important they don't like about\\nthe other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nother's dislike criteria.\" \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \\n\\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It's also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another person's limitations.\" \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one. \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\\nget together, ever. \\n\\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while you're healthy and your life and work\\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

What threat does Outlook pose to your organization? It places the company, corporate network and data at risk. Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company reputation and liability with customers at risk, and proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned. >> Have you looked into using a custom sequences file? > More detail please?

Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with  apt. Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least  (including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be  an easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt  doesn't always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in  RHL. >  > Even if it's possible, are there good reasons why maybe I should not do > it and just use the RH iso's (I don't think RH8 will upgrade from > (null), maybe up2date will)?

The only little (unimportant) catch is to replace \"kernel-headers\" by \"glibc-kernheaders\", a simple \"apt-get install glibc-kernheaders\" taking care of that. Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded, some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered as the newest, thus being kept on the system. As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released  version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they  sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your  own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means \"so much has been  changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release  anyway\".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this  from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y. If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;) Thomas  --  The Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - [URL]http://davedina.apestaart.org[/URL] <-*-                      -*-> And every time she sneezes I think it's love and oh lord I'm not ready for this sort of thing <-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*-> URGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - [URL]http://urgent.rug.ac.be[/URL] _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Then again, perhaps the particular font I'm using just has bad bytecodes.  That font is \"QuickType II\", grabbed off my Windows partition, where it was installed by I-have-no-idea-which-application. Anybody else experimenting with bytecode-enabled freetype, presumably with different fonts?  Do you find the same bad antialiased rendering that I found, or do other fonts work well? _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me.    Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a  sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked,  well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with  and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below.  The first, \"no-bytecodes.png\",  shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode  interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, \"bytecodes.png\", taken with  the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several  rendering anomalies appear:    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in \"R\" and \"o\".    - The left side of the \"Q\" is painted in too light a shade of grey,      causing it to drop out somewhat.  \"C\", not in this sample, has the      same problem.    - \"Qu\" are set right up against each other, with insufficient      whitespace between them.    - \"M\" is distinctly asymmetric.    - The enclosed loop of \"a\" looks muddy, as it is partially filled      with grey.  Contrast with \"a\" drawn without the bytecode      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off.  It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of  making a mess of antialiased rendering.

Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

The two men pioneered the construction of giant\\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\\nthe sun by the billion.\\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because\\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\\nIn fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and\\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\\nsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.\\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba\\nalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach\\nDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.\\nThis year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney\\nBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,\\n55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the\\nKarolinska Institute.\\nThe researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ\\ngrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how\\nviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as\\nAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.\\nThe winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday\\nmorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of\\nAlfred Nobel later the same day.\\nThe literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish\\nAcademy said on Tuesday.\\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -\\nwill be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\\nThe award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are\\nnot publicly revealed for 50 years.\\nAlfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who\\nendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.\\nIn his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to\\nthose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and\\n``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field\\nof physics.''\\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and\\neconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts\\nin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted\\nin strict secrecy.\\nThe prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in\\n1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.\\n---\\nOn the Net:\\nNobel site, [URL]http://www.nobel.se[/URL] \\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It's very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they're here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming.

The new\\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\\nchurch.\\nNevertheless, the society said: \"It is clear that he prefers his private\\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\\n\"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\\ndown,\" it said.\\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an \"action plan,\" including calling on\\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\\nDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\\n\"taking steps towards appropriate direct action\".\\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\\nsociety's chairman, said: \"Watch this space.\" Presumably it could involve a\\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\\nis present.\\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\\nevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\\nA letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the\\nevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\\nteaching.\\nOn the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption\\nand blackmail. \"It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,\" she said.\\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. \"Matters of sexuality\\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.\"\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!
