[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir/Ma, \\nI am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!\\n 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : [URL]www.thisdayonline.com[/URL] , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!\\n 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10\\n% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.\\nBest Regards. \\nHajia Maryam Abacha.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  \\n\\nDr. Kataga Bakori\\nLagos, Nigeria.\\n23rd July 2002\\n\\n\\nAttention President/C.E.O\\n                   \\nDear Sir,\\n\\nREQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.\\n\\nFirstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as \\nbeing utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council \\n(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade \\nexhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with \\nyou in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and \\nhope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.\\n\\nWithin the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and \\nprojects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our \\ncontrol as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, \\nwhich we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a \\nforeign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual \\naccount to receive the funds.\\n\\nThe source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria \\nwhich lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded \\nthemselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The \\npresent civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors \\nand as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we \\nhave identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue \\nof our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was \\ntherefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas \\npartner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY \\nONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.\\n\\n the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed \\nso as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government \\nfinancial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation \\nof some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria \\n(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or \\nany other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main \\npartner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of \\naccount information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for \\npayment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, \\nand prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process \\nwould be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist \\nus in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 \\nmillion (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for \\ntaxation and miscellaneous expenses.\\n\\nThe business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and \\nconfidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful \\nexecution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will \\nnot disappoint me. \\n\\nI will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your \\nknowledge when I have heard from you.\\n\\nThanks for your co-operation,\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDr. Kataga Bakori\\n\\nNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 \\n7591666  \\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

This is the letter you\\nhave been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this\\nletter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an\\nentire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it\\nreally can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\\nprogram was legal.  \\n  \\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws\\nprohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the\\nsimple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of\\npocket cost''.  \\n  \\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,\\nIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  \\n  \\nThis is what one had to say:  \\n  \\n\"I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in\\n21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"  \\n  \\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.  \\n  \\n===================================================  \\n  \\nHere is another testimonial:  \\n  \\n\"This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But\\none day when I received it again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.\\nI followed the simple instructions and walaa .... 3 weeks later the money\\nstarted to come in.  \\n  \\n The first month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a\\ntotal of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program,\\nI have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\\nsomething happens to your computer.  \\n  \\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each\\nreport, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is\\ninstructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will lose out on a majority\\nof your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how\\nit does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and\\nif you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their\\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But\\nit does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then\\nnothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is\\ninstructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember, honesty\\nreaps the reward!!!  \\n  \\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE\\nthe name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it\\nthrough the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  \\n  \\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  \\n  \\n3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  \\n  \\n4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  \\n  \\n5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  \\n  \\n6.... **Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.** **PLEASE MAKE  \\nSURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!  \\n**  \\n==========================================================  \\n  \\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on\\nyour computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  \\n  \\nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you\\nwith marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send\\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:  \\n  \\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  \\n==========================================================  \\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also\\nassume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be\\nmuch better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out\\nhundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).  \\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%\\nresponse, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  \\n  \\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\\nThat's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  \\n  \\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  \\n  \\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails\\nsent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.  \\n  \\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50\\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5  \\n  \\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).  \\nYour total income in this example is:  \\n1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \\+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000\\n\\nGrand Total=$555,550.00  \\n  \\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE\\nRESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF\\nMONEY !  \\n  \\n=========================================================  \\n  \\nREMEMBER FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU\\nMAILED TO.  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are\\nover 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me,\\nmany people will do just that, and more!  \\n  \\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  \\n=======================================================  \\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE\\nplaces to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get\\na larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add\\nMETHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is\\ne-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day\\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with\\nyour name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise\\nuntil they receive the report.  \\n  \\n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================  \\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.\\nCURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is\\nconcealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets\\nof paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR\\nE-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  \\n  \\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW!!  \\n====================================================  \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n**REPORT # 1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net  \\n**  \\nOrder Report #1 from:  \\nB.H.  \\n218 Timberwood  \\nIrvine, Cal  92620\\n\\nUSA\\n\\n  \\n ________________________________________________________  \\n **REPORT # 2: The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the Net  \\n**  \\nOrder Report # 2 from:  \\n J.B.

If you did not, continue\\nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do.  \\n  \\n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX,\\nbecause the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to\\nroll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on\\nthe list, you are placed in front of a Different report.  \\n  \\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF\\nE-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.  There is NO LIMIT to the income\\nyou can generate from this business !!!  \\n  \\n======================================================  \\n  \\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  \\n  \\nYou have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the\\nrest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make\\nmore money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined.\\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It\\nworks exceedingly well as it is now.  \\n  \\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name\\nand address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed\\nabove. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails\\nand your name will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more you\\nsend out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have\\ngiven you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become\\nfinancially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  \\n  \\n============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================  \\n  \\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant\\nwith a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received\\nthis program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of\\nthe whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages\\ninvolved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed\\nintelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless\\nfun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the\\nthing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received\\n50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00\\n........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois  \\n  \\n======================================================  \\n  \\n''Not being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to\\nparticipate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the\\ninitial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't\\nget enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I\\nfound my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in\\nthe first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter\\nwhere people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return\\nand so big.\"  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada  \\n  \\n=======================================================  \\n  \\n''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\\nelse.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not\\ndelete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money\\ncame within 22 weeks.\"  Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.  \\n  \\n=======================================================  \\n  \\n''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little\\ncost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days\\nthe money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end\\nof third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx\\nto internet.\".

Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar \\nwas held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I \\nwas opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of \\nALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan \\naccomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part \\nof the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is \\none of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in \\nthis part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a \\nparticular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that \\nhe buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys \\nto the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find \\nout if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering \\nthe  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market  \\nwhich is affecting his business.\\n\\nBack in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to \\nhandle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and  \\ndiscovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE \\nfor $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & \\nCATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of \\nwhich  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement \\nwith my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each \\nsupply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the \\nreceipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to \\ngive me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its \\nlowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences.\\n\\nHowever, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him  \\nwith 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the \\noppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer \\nof this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will \\npay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me \\nthat he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now \\nwaiting for me to link him to the producer of\\nthe vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell \\nat  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down \\npayment of  50% of our quoted price first.\\n\\nIf you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my \\nbehalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree \\non the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the \\ncontacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI \\nNURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and \\nwe  should never allow him to know the\\ncontact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal \\ndirectly with them.\\n\\nThanks for your cooperation.\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMR KONAN ALAIN\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

How would you like \\nto generate more income through a different avenue? What \\nif it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another \\nprogram, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. \\nThere \\nis NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!\\n\\nTHE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW\\nTHOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH \\nYOU \\nIS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!\\n\\nHere's something which (I trust) will be of interest\\nto you! Please read all of this. This is not something \\nthat I would normally look at, except that I read an \\narticle in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about \\nPayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it \\nwould work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had\\nalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. \\nYou can complete this whole process in one hour and you \\nwill never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! \\nDid I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the \\nInternet-type fast.' Everything is done on the\\nInternet by E-mail.\\n\\nNEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from\\nindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a \\nlittle of their time.\\n\\nTESTIMONIALS FROM:\\n\\nTony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:\\nHey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of\\nour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 \\ngrand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run \\nthis program again........\\n\\nMary Gathers, Columbia, SC:\\nHey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to\\nyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said \\nand went on vacation. When I got back, my account was \\nup to over $12,000! I owe you!\\n\\nGETTING STARTED.\\n\\nIf you're not already a user, the very first thing you\\nneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes \\nand PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this \\nprogram FREE!\\n\\nHere's the link:\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\nBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO \\n$100 \\nDOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!\\n\\nThen...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) \\nto the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note\\nlike \"Please add me to your mailing list.\" BE PREPARED TO GET\\nEXCITED.... YOU \\nWON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the \\nothers \\nto start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No \\nprinting, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US \\nPostal and \\nLottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, \\nSection 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal \\nRegulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a \\nproduct or service must be exchanged for money received). \\n\\nHere's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this \\nTHREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much\\nfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY \\nHIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see \\nresults in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT \\nMONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 \\nor more as in other programs). Ideally, you should\\nsend them to people who send their programs to you or to \\npersonal contacts who are already working on the web, \\nbecause they know these programs work and they are already \\nbelievers in the system! Besides, this program is \\nMUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already \\nin \\nanother program, stay with it, but do\\nyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! \\n\\nIt's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long \\nbefore others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE \\nperson a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET \\nWHEN \\nYOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have \\na \\nPayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 \\nGIFT \\nto\\nthe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list \\nat No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow \\nthe simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 \\nin your bank account!\\n\\nBecause of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT \\nPOTENTIAL, \\nthis program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 \\ntransaction that you get from PayPal!!!\\n\\nFollow These Simple Instructions: \\n\\nE-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST \\nname on the list (No.1) along with a note saying \\n\"subscribe me to your mailing list\". Only the first \\nperson on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. \\n\\nEdit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the \\nother \\ntwo names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first \\nplace \\nin order to earn money fast! \\nIf you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-\\nmail to then your name will be immediately removed\\nfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if \\nyou add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of \\npeople receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! \\n\\nNOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in \\nthe body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. \\nSend out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.\\n\\nALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the \\nresponse \\ntime is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! \\n\\nConsider this! Millions of people surf the Internet\\neveryday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people \\nto start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move \\nthe other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own \\ne-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is \\nassociated \\nwith your PayPal account.\\n\\n*************************************\\n\\n1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com\\n\\n2.  tomk4@prodigy.net\\n\\n3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com \\n\\n*************************************\\n\\nThere are fifty thousand new people who get on the\\nInternet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses \\nis the people who send you offers by email.\\nThe source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to\\nthink of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I \\nsay 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's \\nso easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!\\nTo send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE\\nand paste it in the message of your E-mail. \\n\\nTO DO THIS:\\n1. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and \"select all\"\\n2. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and select \"copy\"\\n3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure\\nit's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)\\n4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box\\n5. Go to \"edit\" and \"paste\" (Then you can format it\\nanyway you want!)\\n\\n\\nNow you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the\\ntop name, adding your name and address to the bottom \\nof the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, \\nYOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT \\nforget \\nto send $5.00 via PayPal (along \\nwith your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL\\naddress before deleting it!\\n\\nNOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in\\nthis e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal \\nreferring URL;\\n\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.\\nWhen your name reaches the first position in a few\\ndays, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!\\nThe money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people\\nlike yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to \\nreceive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a \\ntotal of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) \\nin two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is \\nreal money that you can spend on anything you wish!\\nJust deposit it to your own bank account or spend it \\ndirectly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that \\neasy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?\\n\\nGO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4\\nTHOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?\\n\\nIF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF\\nCOURSE YOU CAN---\\n\\nThis plan is structured for everyone to send only 20\\nletters each. However, you are certainly not limited \\nto 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters \\nyou send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can \\nE-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! \\nTHE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run \\nthis \\nprogram, just follow steps 1\\nthrough 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! \\nSimple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no \\nmailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the \\nprinter or copier, and you can do it again and again \\nwith your regular groups or gift givers, or start up \\na new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the \\nlist. This is proof that you paid to get put on the \\nlist which is the service rendered to make all this \\nlegal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive \\nan MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will \\nclimb to the number one position at dizzying rates. \\nFollow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE \\nPLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. \\nYour name must run the full gamut on the list to produce \\nthe end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list \\nWILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats \\nthe other people who have worked hard and have earned the \\nright to be there. So please, play by the rules and the \\n$$$ will come to you!\\n$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will \\nprosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, \\nespecially with all the different programs out there \\non the web, but if you don't try this you will \\nnever know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!\\nI've been watching this type of program for years and\\nthis is about as easy and fast as you can get it and \\nit can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, \\nno envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort \\nand faith!!! This program really \"Keeps It Short and Simple\"! \\n\\nOH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link \\nunder your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...\\nso they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when \\nsomeone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! \\nLet's all make some serious money \\n$$$$$$\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO BEGIN:\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\nPlay by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your\\ntime, and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS.\\n\\n\\nFOLLOWING ARE SOME NOTES ABOUT PayPal WHICH YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL:PayPal \\nlets \\nyou pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online \\npayment \\nservice - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands \\nand \\nthousands of online shops.

I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor. Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN): ================================================== Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money. Their findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs.\" DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE. This is what one had to say: \"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?\" Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: \"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and that's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.\" Greg Moran, Boston, MA.

THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.**** As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM! These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT [URL]http://www.cashbynet.net[/URL] to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET: Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a program for everybody.
