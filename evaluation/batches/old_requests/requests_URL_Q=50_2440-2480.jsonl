However, this correspondence is \\nunofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. \\n\\nAt first I \\nwill like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble \\nfree to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE \\nIN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS \\nACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime\\nMinister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United \\nKingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of\\n(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS \\nSTERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family \\nvaluables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine \\ninspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. \\nOf (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS \\nSTERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that \\nthe account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the \\naccount. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the \\nformer operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that \\nnobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can \\nonly claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, \\n\\nTherefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide \\nall necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in \\nGod that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa \\nEdine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek \\nAudi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, \\nand was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) \\nbefore his last resignation from office on October 20,\\n2004. The late \\nRafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to \\naround 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the \\nSaint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information \\nplease log on to ([URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL]\\n\\nI WANT TO TRANSFER THIS \\nMONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER \\nWHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A \\nSURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL \\nAND A GENUINE BUSINESS.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi -\\n\\n( [URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL] )\\n\\nYou get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.\\nMost of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.\\nAnd they expect you to listen to them?\\n\\nEnough.\\n\\nIf you want to make money with your computer, then you should\\nhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making\\na large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will\\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\\n\\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\\ncan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send\\nan email, you can do this.  No special \"skills\" are required.\\n\\nHow much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \\ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\\nand rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if\\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\\njust the thing you are looking for.\\n\\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,\\nthere are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -\\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\\neach month also).\\n\\nInterested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a\\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\\ndecide it is not for you.

I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\\n\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. \\n\\nMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!\\n political asylum.\\n\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. \\n\\nPresident Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.\\n\\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\\n\\nYour role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \\n\\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \\n\\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\\n\\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \\n\\nPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\\n\\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read. \\n\\n[URL]http://www.the-idler.com[/URL]\\n\\nSincerely,\\nO.C.Savimbi.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Email:kcole444@yahoo.co.uk ATTENTION: I am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),London. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.  These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP)have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54 ,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts,including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included.Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of Hami Ramzy with a credit balance of 15,800,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased benefi ciaries who died interstate living no wills). Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch.  The funds will be banked in the Holland, London or Spain, being a safe for funds and we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of my job,  I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you. Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax.  For the fund to be transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name and country via any of the corresponding banks in London or Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world.  My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 pe r cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED, The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks. Thanking you in anticipation for your prompt response.

You shall read more about the crash on \\nvisiting this website:\\n\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nThe Owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great \\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska.It is therefore upon this discovery \\nthat I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to \\nrelease the money to you.\\nYou have to follow the instruction which I will be send to you as the next \\nof kin or relation to the deceased for safety and\\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this \\nmoney to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the \\nbanktreasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three \\nyears and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been\\ntransfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that \\nwill know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.\\n\\nThis request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned \\nby the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinab cannot standas \\nnext of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering \\nyou 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other \\ncharges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the \\nremaining 65% is for me.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply,i will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for \\nthis money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr;Morris Thomson. I will \\nnot fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and \\nthat you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have\\nbeen made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you \\nreceive this mail through the above email.\\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER MY\\nURGENT REQUEST.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nDR.AME BENJAMIN\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \\n[URL]http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office \\nthat no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.\\n So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like youas a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n \\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. \\n There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bankaccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for anyexpenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Wang  Qin\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site torrentgods.comr\\n- [URL]http://torrentgods.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Test The CD, when you're 100% satisfied that the CD is everything and more than it claims to be -  then send $49.95 by check. money order or credit card. Our claim to fame, is that our addresses are deliverable!  The number #1 problem with email lists are  deliverability. You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased a list in  the past. Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago! Not ours, a new  volume CD comes out every 6-7 weeks.  Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists: 1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates.  2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No address with inappropriate or  profane wording survive!  3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the \"Web Poisoned\" e-mail addresses from the list. Our EXCLUSIVE system reduced these \"poison\" addresses to near zero. You may have seen CD's with 30, 40,  50 million addresses, not only do they contain many undeliverable addresses, but most are notorious for  millions of these \"poisoned\" email addresses. 4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known \"extremists\" and kicked off every one we could  find.
