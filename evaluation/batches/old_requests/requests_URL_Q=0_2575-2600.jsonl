Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to \\nget a good and capable business person in your country for both business and \\ninvestment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am  Barrister \\nFrank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson \\nan American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost \\nhis life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on \\nJanuary 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.\\n\\nYou can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,\\n\\n1. [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n2. [URL]http://www.nativefederation.org[/URL]\\n\\nBefore the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit \\nfor 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE \\nHUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity \\nseveral notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no \\nresponse came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his \\nfamily had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it \\nwas also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's  next of kin was his daughter \\nwho died with him in the crash.\\n\\nWhat bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the \\nexpiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. \\nGOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my \\nsuggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the \\nnext of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these \\nfunds for both of us.\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:-\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall \\ncome out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document \\nthat will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.\\n\\nPLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW,\\n\\n[1] NAME:\\n\\n[2] ADDRESS:\\n\\n[3] AGE:\\n\\n[4] SEX:\\n\\n[5] TELEPHONE:\\n\\n[6] FAX:\\n\\n[7] OCCUPATION STATUS:\\n\\nAlso be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to \\naccomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been \\nmade the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your \\nbehalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in \\nyour favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided \\nby you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities \\nto see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the \\nnecessary documents.\\n\\nPlease note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times \\nduring this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your \\nnominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for \\nyou and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this \\ntransaction. If you are not interested, please delete this letter so that I \\ncan scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction. Should \\nyou be interested please send me your full names, telephone, fax number and \\nemail address as stated above.

I wouldn't go much deep detailing the problem I am having in my own country Zimbabwe, but you can have a look on This web-site;[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL] html, if you have the time you will understand the kind of brutal president we have.\\n \\n\\nBefore the sudden death of my father, he foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe and decided to make a deposit SUM OF$30 MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS)in disguise as consignment in a box with a Security Company in European  . And he was forced to disclose this to me alone as his first son. And with faith, I am going to disclose the details to you,  hoping that you will understand me and keep the secret to yourself, and most importantly to stand as the beneficiary to this fund, so that non of my country people we have any reason to track this money back. \\n\\n\\nThis money was deposited as family valuables due to the heat of the problem in Zimbabwe , so that the government will not try to confiscate the money if discovered. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland . The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President \"MR. ROBERT MUGABE\" introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my Father was one of the victims. And because of this development I flew to Dubai to stay as a refugee. \\n\\n\\n>From the studies I have been able to make in Dubai concerning the right of a refugee, a lot of question will arise if I make any attempt to claim this fund directly concerning my age. And for the fact that I will not like to stay permanently in Dubai due to there law of not issuing permanent resident to foreigners. I am looking forward to stay in a country that the law will give me full right with time. And to have a good guardian that is knowledgeable in business and investment. It is just on this background that I have contacted you.\\n\\n\\nPlease, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account as soon as it is being claim from the Security Company. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 10% is mapped out to re-in-burse all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 60% will be for me and my family investment in your country under your kind control. \\n\\n\\nNote that this transaction is 100% clear and risk-free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal base on the little advice my let father gave to me. The only thing am soliciting from you is the total assistance to make a claim of the fund on your name from the Security Company, and after which the money will be paid into your account in your country \\n\\n\\nI need your complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account. Kindly keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons. If you are interested in assisting me, Reply via the above email address and include your private phone and fax numbers. I will respond to you immediately. \\nLooking forward to your urgent reply, God Bless. \\n\\nSincerely Yours, \\nMr. mark Abdul \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhora tambi&eacute;n puedes acceder a tu correo Terra desde el m&oacute;vil.\\n\\nInf&oacute;rmate pinchando aqu&iacute;.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am (Ben Coroma  Esq),asenior staff in file\\ndepartment in African developent bank (ADB).I gotyour contact from a\\ntourist from your country who was in this country and transacted a\\nbusiness with our bank. When i was searching for aforeign partner i\\nassured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees\\nopportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars( fifteen million\\nU.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one ofour foreign customer \\nwho died along with his entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane\\ncrash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting\\nhis next of kin to come over and claim hismoney because we can not release\\nit unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the\\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we\\nlearnt that all his supposed next ofkin or relation died along side with\\nhim at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my\\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety\\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t\\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The\\nBanking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money\\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the\\nBank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin\\nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a\\nforeigner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We\\nagree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman\\ncolleague.

The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED \\nTHOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)\\n\\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \\nBonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \\nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your \\ninterest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this \\ngreat business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nto the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money \\nto be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \\nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \\nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking \\nlaw and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed \\nafter five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as \\nunclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is \\noccasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe \\ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \\nbills, while 65% will be for me.

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent Nkono, the first son of  Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.\\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum.\\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. \\nNow the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this transaction with you.\\n \\nIf you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Security Company. \\nI have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your account, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, it is opened for negotiation. \\nI have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the above email address,  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.\\n\\nThanks, GOD BLESS YOU \\nYours Faithfully, \\nGeorge Nduumba. \\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \\n[URL]www.freeserve.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

BRANCH,\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3years and 10months  the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. \\n Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n \\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.\\n Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.\\n Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Wang  Qin\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n[URL]http://snura.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
