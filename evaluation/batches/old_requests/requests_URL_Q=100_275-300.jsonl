Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA ([URL]http://www.tmda.net[/URL]  In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). \t\t\t\t  -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.   Reasons:   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls   getservbyname() which does a lookup against \"smtp\" in /etc/services).   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead   of SMTP.   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv   which creates problems:     Postfix does not support \"-bv\" and returns in error     Exim does not support \"-t\" with \"-bv\" and returns in error     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.   \"whom\" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.       It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout     about this.  The \"-bv\" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in     /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's \"whom\" support using Exim's system filter:   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:     DATADIR     ALLOW_MODE_640     CRYPT_KEY_FILE     FINGERPRINT   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group \"mail\".   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:     message_filter = \"/etc/exim/filter\"     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:     # Exim filter     testprint \"local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}\"     testprint \"domain: ${domain: $h_From:}\"     if \"$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:\" is \"\" and         \"${domain: $h_From:}\" is \"kanga.nu\" and        \"${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}\" is \"true\"     then       pipe \"/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config\"       finish     endif   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for   your setup. Basic explanation:   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different   user, chgrp as appropriate.   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I   haven't investigated that end. Notes:   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if   you wish.   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA   configuration.

Before the best methods took\\nO(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.\\nThe precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes\\ntime O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding\\nsome logarithmic factors.\\n\\nAfter lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the\\nnumber of points on the curve.\\n\\nHere's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using\\na 1 GHz Pentium III:\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n> ./ecpc4 -d 1009 -j 0x123\\nINFO: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\\nINFO: -=-=-=-=-= ECPC: Elliptic Curve Point Counting, made easy! =-=-=-=-=-\\nINFO: -=-=-=-=-= v4.0.0.

Since SeditBeautify assumes we are in a sedit window the routine fails. (Try typing ctrl-l over the main window to see what I mean). The quick fix for this is to make the ^l more restrictive. However, I'd suggest keeping things the way the are and extending ^l to be a highlight toggle. If the window is currently highlighted (sedit or msg) re-display without highlighting and vice versa. While I can hack tcl, hacking tk is another story. Translation: I can't  fix this bug myself. Any volunteers?

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no longer marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average). > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Karl > Anderson > Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 1:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech way >  > Elias Sinderson  writes: >  > > Sorry, Karl, your confusing things. >  > No, it's just a silly discussion, but that's what picky semantic > discussions turn into :) >  > > Thos is saying that selective > > breeding should be counted as genetic engineering, whereas you are > > extending his definition to include the attration that your parents > felt... >  > Yes, I'm saying that if he extends \"genetic engineering\" to include > selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting > people to breed with. >  > > Unless your parents were selectively bred like livestock to produce you, > > I don't think you can make that case...  :-) >  > I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so > because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be > mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning. >  > What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own > offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals? >  > -- > Karl Anderson      kra@monkey.org [URL]http://www.monkey.org[/URL] > [URL]http://xent.com[/URL] [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Is this actually important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead of three, (and dont you hate books that keep asking questions)? Read the rest of Alex Homer's article here: [URL]http://www.wrox.com[/URL] ========== WROX ANNOUNCEMENTS ========== Author Interviews ***With Franois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook. [AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book. [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.  Read the interview in full: [URL]http://www.wrox.com[/URL] Or read about Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook: [URL]http://www.wrox.com[/URL] ***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET. There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics. What is free threading?  Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.

This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM  [URL]http://www.csharptoday.com[/URL] The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing C# or VB.NET project. ***Get on the Fast Track to Success If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for you. The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

Also it should check that no-one can manage to put in a package with the same name as another one or otherwise sabotage the thing.
