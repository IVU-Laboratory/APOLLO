Since SeditBeautify assumes we are in a sedit window the routine fails. (Try typing ctrl-l over the main window to see what I mean). The quick fix for this is to make the ^l more restrictive. However, I'd suggest keeping things the way the are and extending ^l to be a highlight toggle. If the window is currently highlighted (sedit or msg) re-display without highlighting and vice versa. While I can hack tcl, hacking tk is another story. Translation: I can't  fix this bug myself. Any volunteers?

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no longer marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average). > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Karl > Anderson > Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 1:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech way >  > Elias Sinderson  writes: >  > > Sorry, Karl, your confusing things. >  > No, it's just a silly discussion, but that's what picky semantic > discussions turn into :) >  > > Thos is saying that selective > > breeding should be counted as genetic engineering, whereas you are > > extending his definition to include the attration that your parents > felt... >  > Yes, I'm saying that if he extends \"genetic engineering\" to include > selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting > people to breed with. >  > > Unless your parents were selectively bred like livestock to produce you, > > I don't think you can make that case...  :-) >  > I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so > because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be > mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning. >  > What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own > offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals? >  > -- > Karl Anderson      kra@monkey.org [URL]http://www.monkey.org[/URL] > [URL]http://xent.com[/URL] [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book. [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics. What is free threading?  Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.

This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM  [URL]http://www.csharptoday.com[/URL] The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing C# or VB.NET project. ***Get on the Fast Track to Success If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for you. The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by providing concise guides to core topics.

You handled your own repo and they did a nightly stable update for example. Also it should check that no-one can manage to put in a package with the same name as another one or otherwise sabotage the thing.

The first beta of Vipul's > Razor v2 is now available for public download. 1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta. 2)  When you go to the \"Download\" page, it tells you \"Fetch the latest versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages\"  It is not at all clear that these are development packages. The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the word \"beta\" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design \"fact\": USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*) I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test sites. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. rOD. -- Anyway... long story short... ...is a phrase whose origins are complicated and rambling. >> Doing the blogging thang again at [URL]http://www.groovymother.com[/URL] << ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

The callers are then  changed to pass what the function > expects.  In the case of Msg_Change, the  'line' argument is removed > and we only have the msgid argument.  Ftoc_ClearCurrent is now the > first line of MsgChange.  The following patch removes Ftoc_RescanLine in favour of a  Ftoc_RescanLines. It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc  accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it. It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of  falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an  effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence. It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on  folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does  not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic  scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now  corresponds better to what's on disk. Comments appreciated.

I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed >> (especially those with multiple email addresses...). > > What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain. > Ah the great spam debate wages on ... So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-) Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )   Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down. When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to my @hotmail account. I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more knowledgable. My half a cent here... : I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :) Woo hoo!   Law school!)
