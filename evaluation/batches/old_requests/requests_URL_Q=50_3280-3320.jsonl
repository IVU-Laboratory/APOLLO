Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.\u00a0 They'll tell you it's true.\u00a0 Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.\u00a0 They'll agree 100% that it's true.\u00a0 Don't just take my word for it. In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that it is absolutely true. It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.\u00a0 Really, they can.\u00a0 But, it takes several very important components to join the 5% who are successful on the web. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of those necessities is a website. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, your website does one of two things... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't. For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do not produce results. And there is a very simple reason for poor performance. Poor sales letters. Does your website convince people to make a purchase? If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into your sales letter... 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind. Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your sales letter to.\u00a0 Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat.\u00a0 Write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally.\u00a0 Why? Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind. Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.\u00a0 Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.\u00a0 In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.\u00a0 Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.\u00a0 Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.\u00a0 Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the \"real world.\"\u00a0 It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.\u00a0 Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.\u00a0 Go back to the beginning of this article.\u00a0 The first words were, \"It's true.\"\u00a0 I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.\u00a0 Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.\u00a0 Carefully craft your first line.\u00a0 If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.\u00a0 Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.\u00a0 Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most important things the reader will discover.\u00a0 By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.\u00a0 After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.\u00a0 Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.\u00a0 If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.\u00a0 Write it ALL down.\u00a0 Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.\u00a0 Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.\u00a0 Make sure that the words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.\u00a0 I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"\u00a0 Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.\u00a0 When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at [URL]http://www.keywordcount.com[/URL] and see what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.\u00a0 It's a free service.\u00a0 Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.\u00a0 Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.\u00a0 Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.\u00a0 Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.\u00a0 Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?\u00a0 Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)\u00a0 Stress the benefits, not the features.\u00a0 Again, readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it for\u00a0 me?\"\u00a0 What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?\u00a0 How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?\u00a0 Spell it out.\u00a0 Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:\u00a0 If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.\u00a0 So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.\u00a0 Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.\u00a0 Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.\u00a0 When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.\u00a0 For example: If you are selling a \"work at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.\u00a0 Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.\u00a0 Write another letter targeting senior citizens.\u00a0 Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.\u00a0 The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only 5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only 5 hours a week.\"\u00a0 Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.\u00a0 You could advertise the \"College Students\" page in a campus ezine.\u00a0 The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.\u00a0 And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.\u00a0 Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue.\" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.\u00a0 When the customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\" If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.\"\u00a0 Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.\u00a0 When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?\u00a0 Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster than a speeding bullet.\"\u00a0 \"More powerful than a locomotive.\" \"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.\u00a0 Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.\u00a0 Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.\u00a0 Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.\u00a0 Don't kid yourself.\u00a0 There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.\u00a0 How will you stand out among the crowd?\u00a0 Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.\u00a0 Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.\u00a0 It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.\u00a0 It must create a feeling of \"You won't find this anywhere else.\" 17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\" Delete.\u00a0 Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?\u00a0 Get real.\u00a0 Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.\u00a0 You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.\u00a0 Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.\u00a0 It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.\u00a0 Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.\u00a0 Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.\u00a0 \"What am I really getting here?\u00a0 Does he even know?\" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, \"This person must have counted.\u00a0 I know exactly what I can expect.\"\u00a0 \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They leave no impression whatsoever.\" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.\u00a0 Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.\u00a0 Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"\u00a0 Then, address that in your sales letter.\u00a0 Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.\u00a0 Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.\u00a0 Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.\u00a0 \"If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.\"\u00a0 Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.\u00a0 Use them frequently -but don't overuse.\u00a0 A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.\u00a0 They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.\u00a0 \"Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would you like to be as successful as I am?\"\u00a0 Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.\u00a0 By offering a free item, you can\u00a0 request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.\u00a0 By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.\u00a0 One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.\u00a0 Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\" and \"But that's not all.\"\u00a0 These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.\u00a0 Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.\u00a0 By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. \"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.\"\u00a0 \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.\"\u00a0 Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.\u00a0 Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.\u00a0 Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.\u00a0 Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)\u00a0 Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)\u00a0 Explain when the product will be delivered.\u00a0 How quickly will the order be processed?\u00a0 When will the order be available?\u00a0 Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.\u00a0 The more specific you can be here, the better.\u00a0 Let them know that you have a system in place.\u00a0 \"Operators are standing by.\"\u00a0 Their order will be handled properly.\u00a0 Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.\u00a0 Take away their last reason to hold back.\u00a0 Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day guarantee.\u00a0 Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.\u00a0 You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.\u00a0 Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.\u00a0 Many people just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"\u00a0 \"Order today!\" \"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"\u00a0 You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.\u00a0 Get them to \"Act Fast!\"\u00a0 Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.\u00a0 People will always read the P.S.\u00a0 Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?\u00a0 Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.\u00a0 A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.\u00a0 You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.\u00a0 Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.\u00a0 I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.\u00a0 In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve. \u00a0 Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.\u00a0 They'll tell you it's true.\u00a0 Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.\u00a0 They'll agree 100% that it's true.\u00a0 Don't just take my word for it. In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that it is absolutely true. It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.\u00a0 Really, they can.\u00a0 But, it takes several very important components to join the 5% who are successful on the web. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of those necessities is a website. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, your website does one of two things... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't. For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do not produce results. And there is a very simple reason for poor performance. Poor sales letters. Does your website convince people to make a purchase? If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into your sales letter... 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind. Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your sales letter to.\u00a0 Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your next door neighbor or your cat.\u00a0 Write your sales letter just like you are writing it to them personally.\u00a0 Why? Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind. Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going to be read to an audience rather than one person.\u00a0 Keep your sales letters personal, because one person at a time is going to read them. 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.\u00a0 In my sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback across Montana on a grizzly bear.\u00a0 Leads have read of how getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home a solid message.\u00a0 Tell stories that illustrate a point you are trying to make.\u00a0 Emphasize a benefit by sharing an account from the \"real world.\"\u00a0 It effectively creates interest and further establishes the point. 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first line.\u00a0 Your first line of the sales letter should immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know more.\u00a0 Go back to the beginning of this article.\u00a0 The first words were, \"It's true.\"\u00a0 I can guarantee you that either consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\" Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking about.\u00a0 Before you even knew it you were right here, 8 paragraphs into this article.\u00a0 Carefully craft your first line.\u00a0 If you can immediately get them wanting to know more, you've got a winner. 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer. Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight each line and create a sense of more length to the list. 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.\u00a0 Shortly after your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet list of benefits to absorb.\u00a0 Hit them with your best shot. Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most important things the reader will discover.\u00a0 By offering a killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad copy.\u00a0 After all, if they are already interested after the first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to finding out even more reasons why your product or service will aid them. 6) Just let it all flow out.\u00a0 Write down everything that enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You can edit it later.\u00a0 If you just sit and start writing everything you know about your product or service and how it will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much information floods your mind.\u00a0 Write it ALL down.\u00a0 Then read through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to many of the points.\u00a0 Edit it after you have exhausted all of your ideas. 7) Make your sales letter personal.\u00a0 Make sure that the words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\" Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not yourself.\u00a0 I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes, but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"\u00a0 Leads aren't interested in you or your products, they are interested in themselves and their wants and needs.\u00a0 When you are finished with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test webpage, run a check at [URL]http://www.keywordcount.com[/URL] and see what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.\u00a0 It's a free service.\u00a0 Make sure it's at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. 8) Write like you speak.\u00a0 Forget all of those rules that your grammar teacher taught you.\u00a0 Write your sales letters in everyday language, just like you would talk in person. Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\" Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition. Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest Hemingway. 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each. Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.\u00a0 Use short paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be afraid to use short sentences.\u00a0 Like this one. Or this. See what I mean?\u00a0 Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often force the reader to get distracted. 10)\u00a0 Stress the benefits, not the features.\u00a0 Again, readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it for\u00a0 me?\"\u00a0 What need is it going to meet? What want is it going to fill?\u00a0 How is your product or service going to be of value or benefit to the reader?\u00a0 Spell it out.\u00a0 Don't focus on the features of your product or service , but rather how those features will add value to the life of your reader. For example:\u00a0 If you are selling automobile tires, you may very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world, but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while we are traveling.\u00a0 So, instead of focusing on your selection, you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress the benefits, not the features. 11) Keep the reader interested.\u00a0 Some sales letters read like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to understand.\u00a0 Unless you are writing to a very targeted audience, avoid using technical language that many readers might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language and information that are easy to understand and follow. 12) Target your sales letter.\u00a0 When you are finished with your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a specific audience.\u00a0 For example: If you are selling a \"work at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards women who are homemakers.\u00a0 Then, rewrite the same sales letter and target it to college students.\u00a0 Write another letter targeting senior citizens.\u00a0 Still another could be written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income during summer vacation.\u00a0 The possibilities are endless. All you need to do is add a few words here and there in your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only 5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only 5 hours a week.\"\u00a0 Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website (you could easily target 100's of groups). Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted mediums.\u00a0 You could advertise the \"College Students\" page in a campus ezine.\u00a0 The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be advertised at a retirement community message board. By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product to.\u00a0 And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a match made for them. 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.\u00a0 Use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One thing that I have always found to work very well in sales letters... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...is to use a pause like this. Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also, if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK HERE to continue.\" 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.\u00a0 When the customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\" If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat that let the mouse get away.\"\u00a0 Use words to create a picture in the readers' mind.\u00a0 When you think of Superman, what comes to mind?\u00a0 Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster than a speeding bullet.\"\u00a0 \"More powerful than a locomotive.\" \"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how word pictures stick in our minds? 15) Focus on one product or service.\u00a0 Don't try to sell your customer multiple products at the same time. It only confuses the reader.\u00a0 Keep your ad copy directed at one specific product or service.\u00a0 Then, use other products and services as back-end products. 16) Make it stand out.\u00a0 Don't kid yourself.\u00a0 There are hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the same thing you are doing.\u00a0 How will you stand out among the crowd?\u00a0 Your sales letter must inject personality. It must breathe of originality.\u00a0 Your product or service is different. It's not like all of the rest.\u00a0 It is unique. Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the competition.\u00a0 It must create a feeling of \"You won't find this anywhere else.\" 17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\" Delete.\u00a0 Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or something?\u00a0 Get real.\u00a0 Don't make outrageous claims that are obviously not the truth.\u00a0 You'll ruin your reputation. Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be reversed.\u00a0 Once you have been branded a liar, you will NEVER be anything but a liar.\u00a0 It doesn't matter if you launch the most respectable, honest business available anywhere, people will always have doubt because they remember the crazy stuff you've said before.\u00a0 Be believable. Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but rather be EXACT.\u00a0 Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's mind.\u00a0 \"What am I really getting here?\u00a0 Does he even know?\" When you use specific information, the reader begins to think, \"This person must have counted.\u00a0 I know exactly what I can expect.\"\u00a0 \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They leave no impression whatsoever.\" 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would want to know about your product or service.\u00a0 Answer all of their questions, anything they would want to consider before making a purchase.\u00a0 Think about it from their point of view. Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"\u00a0 Then, address that in your sales letter.\u00a0 Remove anything that would keep the reader from making the purchase. 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.\u00a0 Share actual excerpts from what your current customers are saying about your product or service. Many websites have an entire section or even a separate page that has endorsements and compliments listed.\u00a0 Satisfied customers remove some of the doubt in the mind of the reader.\u00a0 \"If these people have found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I probably will too.\"\u00a0 Especially effective are testimonials from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target field. 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter. A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your ad copy.\u00a0 Use them frequently -but don't overuse.\u00a0 A well- placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.\u00a0 They are that important. 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.\u00a0 \"Wouldn't you like to make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would you like to be as successful as I am?\"\u00a0 Avoid any question that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them feel like they are inferior. 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy. If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try to influence them to buy in the future.\u00a0 By offering a free item, you can\u00a0 request their email address in order to obtain the freebie.\u00a0 By doing this, you can now follow-up with the customer for a potential future sale. Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item. And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful product or service which impresses the customer, they probably will be back as a customer soon. 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.\u00a0 One of the things that I have found very effective in writing sales letters is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product I am offering.\u00a0 Ginsu made this one famous. They were selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages the credibility of your main offer. 25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\" and \"But that's not all.\"\u00a0 These phrases effectively lead the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or leads into bonus items.\u00a0 Again, the idea is MORE and MORE value and benefits to the reader. 26) Always include a deadline.\u00a0 By including a deadline, you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer. \"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the bonuses.\"\u00a0 \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining, I've got to hurry.\"\u00a0 Let the customer know what they will be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember, they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines are very effective.\u00a0 Every sales letter should have one. 27) Tell them exactly how to order.\u00a0 Be clear as to the order process. Point them towards the order link.\u00a0 Tell them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks, etc.)\u00a0 Make this process as simple and clear as can be. If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. 28)\u00a0 Explain when the product will be delivered.\u00a0 How quickly will the order be processed?\u00a0 When will the order be available?\u00a0 Let the customer know exactly what they can expect when they place their order.\u00a0 The more specific you can be here, the better.\u00a0 Let them know that you have a system in place.\u00a0 \"Operators are standing by.\"\u00a0 Their order will be handled properly.\u00a0 Tell them. 29) Offer a money back guarantee.\u00a0 Take away their last reason to hold back.\u00a0 Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day guarantee.\u00a0 Most people may not realize this, but in most cases, it's the law of the land.\u00a0 You are REQUIRED to give them their money back if they are not satisfied with the product or service.\u00a0 Since it's the law anyway, why not make it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your product or service RISK-FREE. 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.\u00a0 Many people just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"\u00a0 \"Order today!\" \"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"\u00a0 You've got them this far, now tell them what you want them to do.\u00a0 Get them to \"Act Fast!\"\u00a0 Have you ever heard a mail order commercial on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right way? 31) Include a post script.\u00a0 People will always read the P.S.\u00a0 Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of your sales letter. Why?\u00a0 Because in many cases the visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.\u00a0 A P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed description of what they will receive for their money. Use your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. 32) Include a second post script.\u00a0 You better believe if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.\u00a0 Use this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would make them want to order.\u00a0 I guarantee you they will read it. Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see a significant increase in the amount of responses you receive from your sales letters.\u00a0 In fact, it would be impossible for your responses to not improve. \u00a0 Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

This is often because webmasters do not have the ability or time to design and create unique websites. These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design for your website. 1. Navigation System Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first things to consider when designing your website. Visitors usually look for a way to get to the information they want before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase  ([URL]http://www.webmasterbase.com[/URL] for example. There is a list  of categories on the left, and information about the network  on the top bar. It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the bottom of the page because: - People see the top of the page first - If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets    pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor. 2. Color Scheme When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some colors that are often used are white on black or black on white. A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer ([URL]http://www.godigitalstudios.com[/URL], created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles  ([URL]http://www.freewarefiles.com[/URL], Tucows ([URL]http://www.tucows.com[/URL], or Download.com ([URL]http://www.download.com[/URL] for \"color schemer.\" 3. Content Window This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand. Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what  you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write your own content, it sure is worth it. To find content for your website, try searching at EzineArticles ([URL]http://www.ezinearticles.com[/URL] Other people may have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content from other  authors, as mentioned above. 4. Font(s) Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New. Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.) Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be  used for long pieces of text. The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs, or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times (Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif, is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it easier to read. 5. Advertising Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing  that almost every website has. The most common type is what  is known as \"banner\" advertising. It is called that because it is  long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The  generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high. New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new style called \"skyscraper\" -- so called for a reason: it looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too wide (about 100-125 pixels.) Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners  used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page. Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.     Conclusion These are only five things to consider when designing a website. There are many others however. Let me know what  you find that helps you create a unique website.

This is often because webmasters do not have the ability or time to design and create unique websites. These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design for your website. 1. Navigation System Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first things to consider when designing your website. Visitors usually look for a way to get to the information they want before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase ([URL]http://www.webmasterbase.com[/URL] for example. There is a list of categories on the left, and information about the network on the top bar. It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the bottom of the page because: - People see the top of the page first - If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor. 2. Color Scheme When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some colors that are often used are white on black or black on white. A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer ([URL]http://www.godigitalstudios.com[/URL], created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles ([URL]http://www.freewarefiles.com[/URL], Tucows ([URL]http://www.tucows.com[/URL], or Download.com ([URL]http://www.download.com[/URL] for \"color schemer.\" 3. Content Window This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here is easy to read and understand. Also, provide your own original content.

From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost.

Voici maintenant que notre \u00ab p\u00e8re \u00bb la France et la communaut\u00e9 internationale menacent de bloquer nos biens, et que toutes nos sorties d\u2019argent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par cette communaut\u00e9 intern\\n ationale, c\u2019est alors que je viens aupr\u00e8s de vous pour solliciter votre appui et aide pour que je transf\u00e8re 8.5 millions d\u2019Euros que j\u2019ai gard\u00e9 dans une banque locale de mon pays \u00e0 Abidjan sur le compte d\u2019une de mes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Je veux que vous compreniez que tous nos comptes qui se trouvent en Italie, Suisse, Canada et la France sont d\u00e9tect\u00e9s par la France, pour cette raison, je ne peux plus effectuer de transfert sur ces comptes, et je ne peux plus ouvrir d\u2019autres comptes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. C\u2019est alors dans ce cas que je vous sollicite afin de prendre contact avec moi pour que nous fassions connaissance et que je vous mette par la suite en contact avec cette banque pour que vous fassiez toutes les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour transf\u00e9rer ces 8.5 millions d\u2019Euros dans le compte de votre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou votre compte priv\u00e9. La raison de cette d\u00e9cision est que je ne sais pas combien de temps notre r\u00e9gime tiendra encore. Dans l\u2019attente de votre r\u00e9ponse, veuillez agr\u00e9ez messieurs recevoir mes \\n salutations les plus sinc\u00e8res.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        From: J.Rodney chesson jr \\nChesson Family Corporation, \\nLiberia. \\nemail: chesson_joseph@yahoo.com\\n\\nKindest attention, I am very sorry for the informal\\nmanner in which this mail is reaching you. This is\\nnecessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable\\nand trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem\\nstrange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence\\nand pray that you take my request very serious.I am\\nMr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.\\nF. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to\\n1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12\\nother Liberian Government officials was assassinated\\nas a result of a military coup that toppled the\\ngovernment of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May\\nhis soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family\\nhas always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.\\nYou can view our family web page below; \\n([URL]http://www.chessonfamily.com[/URL]\\nbut please do not call me \\non the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed\\nbugged by the government.\\n\\nI received information from a reliable source that\\ndescribed your country as being economically conducive\\nfor investment and her people as transparent and\\ntrustworthy to engaging business, which made me to\\nwrite you. As you may want to know and to make you\\nless curious, I got your email address from an\\nInternet site that portrayed you in good light. \\nEarly this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the\\nremoval of\\nPresident Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good\\nexample of a bad leader. The President who needed\\nsupport from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum\\nof twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$\\n28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation\\nfor my late father and solicited for my support. I\\nquickly made an arrangement with a courier company\\nhere in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset\\nmanagement company in \\nthe uk. I did not support\\nPresident Charles Taylor because my conscience is not\\nfor sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in\\nLiberia, he placed all the eligible members of my\\nfamily under travel watch,confiscated all our\\ntraveling documents and frozen all our account in\\nLiberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia\\nand different peace keeping meetings were held and\\nPresident Taylor was advised to step down for national\\npeace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles\\nTaylor flied into exile but the problem we are having\\nnow is that he handed over power to his Vice-President\\nMoses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was\\nthe person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all\\nour traveling documents and frozen all our account in\\nLiberia. That is why I requested for your sincere\\nassistance pending when a fresh election will be held\\nhere. The main rebel faction Liberians United for\\nReconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to\\ncontinue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The\\nrebels are not happy with the above development so\\nthey still continued fighting. \\n\\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the\\nownership of the consignment /boxes containing the\\ncash to you and issue you a power of attorney through\\nmy Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to\\nthe money as my proxy from the company in europe.\\n\\nThe entire operation is risk free since it is only you\\nand me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the\\nmoney after you must have taken the money to your\\ncountry where it is save my lawyer will then meet you\\nin your country to use my share of the money for\\ninvestment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is\\nneeded to transfer this fund, I propose a commission\\nof 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for\\nthe expected services and assistance. Your private fax\\nand telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy\\nconclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life\\nnow) urgently. Your urgent response via the above\\nemail address is highly needed so as to stop further\\ncontact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to\\nexercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter\\nextra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision\\nwhile I await your prompt response. Our phone line\\nboth home and abroad are bugged. So dont call me. I\\nwill always call you at my convenient time and in a\\nconducive atmosphere.

I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to Live, according to medical experts.\\n\\nI have not particularly lived my Life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on \\nmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all these as I now know that there are more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\\n\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I \\nwould live my Life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that \\nGod has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and \\nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few \\nclose friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided \\nto give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some \\ncharity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my \\nhealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.\\n\\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and \\ndistribute the money which I have there to charity organization in \\nBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. \\n\\nHence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended \\nwith what I have left for them.\\n\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $20,500,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.\\n\\nI have set aside 15% for you, then 5% for any expenses insured.\\n\\nGod be with you.\\n\\nSALIM IBRAHIM\\n\\nNOTE: PLEASE I WISH TO SINCERELY ADVICED THAT I CAN BE REACHED ON MY WEBMAIL ADDRESS BELOW:\\n\\nsalim_ib@myway.com\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at [URL]http://frenchdog.ru[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"RUS\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section \\nof AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. \\nWith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to \\nkeep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service \\nafter we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nGeorge Path.\\n\\nMOBILE NUMBER: 00226 78 01 64 64.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \\ntlphone portable !

This business request may seem strange, but\\nI crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am\\nconvinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to\\na money transfer.\\n  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with \\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr.Robert Rice  made a numbered  time (fixed)\\ndeposit for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars\\n)in  my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his\\nforwarding address but got no reply.\\n  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.Robert\\nRice and his wife Mrs. Mary Rice died in the plane crash On October\\n31, 1999, (an  Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers\\non board as you can  confirm it yourself via the website below: \\n\\n [URL]http://www.greatdreams.com[/URL]\\n\\n On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a\\nWill and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I\\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr.Robert\\nRice did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his\\nofficial documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.\\nThis sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over\\nwith the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever\\ncome forward to claim it according to African law, at the expiration\\nof (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\\nSenegal Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner\\nto  stand as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Rice so that the fruit of\\nthis  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\\nGovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\\nimmediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will\\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in\\nplace as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of an attorney\\nfor the drafting and notarization of the Will and obtain the\\nnecessary\\ndocuments and letter  of probate administration in your favour for\\nthe transfer.\\n  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide\\nwill  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\\nbeneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for\\nus to share in ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you.. There is no\\nrisk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and\\nmy position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful\\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply\\nimmediately via the private email address below, upon your\\nresponses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant\\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction.\\n   Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that\\nthis  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\\nshall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the\\nfollowing  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer\\ninto your bank account:\\n   1.)

I have contacted the finance firm and confirmed the safety of the money/ inheritance.  As it is I have the intention of investing the fund in oversees, and however I needed a foreigner who is capable of giving adequate assistance to me by the way of clearing the money from the finance firm and the reefer forwarding it to your account for investment. I have map out 35% percentage of the fund for you, please do feel free to ask me questions on this as I wait for your reply soonest to my email. joelthomson05@jmail.co.za.
