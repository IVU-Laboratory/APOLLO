In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of\\nUS$20M dollars (Twenty Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of\\nour late foreign customer (MR.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is\\noccassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Indigen here\\ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nAll I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.\\n\\n\\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will\\nprotect you from any breach of the law.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of\\na foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the\\nbusiness,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charity\\norganisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for me\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the\\npercentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this\\nfund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin\\nof the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your private\\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where\\nin the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the\\napplication . I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is\\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required\\narrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately\\nas soon as you receive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nMr.Stefan Dusza.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir,I am Mr.Eric Madu,\u00a0 I got your contact through a friend who attended a trade mission in your country, but I did not disclose the nature of the business to him. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Charles Fredrick with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,000.00(Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:[URL]www.thestate.com[/URL] on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL,and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Fredrick did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$20,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest isbeing rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Fredrick so that the fruit of this\u00a0 old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple,I will like you to provide immediately your fullname and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction.  If you are interested,please reply immediately via the private email address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assitance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me the following,to enable start the process of the fund into your bank\u00a0 account: 1. Your full Name and contact address.2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication. Immediately I recieve a mail indicating your interest I shall send you more details. Thanks and Regards, Mr.Eric Madu.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

In an account that belongs to one ofour foreign customer  who died along with his entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim hismoney because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next ofkin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money \\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. \\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer ofthis fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, yourbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or emailthe text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any  atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made forthetransfer. \\nYou should contact me on this email (00226-7885 7597)immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear fromyou immediately. \\nYour's faithfully, \\nBen Coroma  (Esq.) \\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always. \\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. \\n I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to \\nprovide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.\\n We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.\\n Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.\\n The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business . \\n There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\n Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n Please upon your approval of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:\\n1.) The beneficiary's name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\n I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.\\n I do not find this move against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn't even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.

I know that\\nthe contents of this mail might sound so strange, but I want to assure you that every word of it is true.I am Mr.Abgottspon Ewald, a credit officer with Banque Jacob Safra(Schweiz)AG.I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the \\nplane crash of Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic on February 26, 2004 ,Dimka Ilkova Boskovic from the Ministry of Foreign \\nAffairs,macedonia and also a business woman made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, with a value of Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.You can visit this website:\\n\\n[URL]http://www.rferl.org[/URL]\\n\\n\\nThe board of directors of my bank adopted a resolution and as the accounting officer to Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic I was mandated to provide her next of kin for the payment of this money within 14 working days or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned property. Further investigations revealed that Dimka Ilkova Boskovic did not declare any next of kin in her official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And she also confided in me the last time she was at my office that no one except me knew of her deposit in my bank. So Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that the directors of my bank had planned to invoke the abandoned property decree of 1991 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the period given to me, despairing at the point of exhaustiveness but fortunately, I came across your name. My suggestion \\nto you is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkova Boskovic so that you will be able to receive this funds.\\n\\nHowever, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the deceased. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkova Boskovic. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Be Inform also that we shall share the funds in the ratio 70% for me and 25% for you, while 5% should be for Expenses or Tax as your Government may require. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction \\nwhen I hear from you. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated via my private email address(aewald2000@msn.com).\\n\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nMr.Abgottspon Ewald.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Due to my client's inability to travel out of the country presently and the fact that we continue to accumulate huge debts daily as long as this consignment remains in the security company,we need a friend and partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve this money on behalf of my client and handle it as duely instructed. We have agreed in principle to give thirty-percent (30%) of the total sum to whomever shall handle this fund for us while the remaining seventy-percent (70%) shall be for my !\\n client and I. As soon as you are ready to proceed and retrieve this cash on our behalf we shall furnish you with the details and information you will need.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Attn: The President /ceo \\n\\nDear, \\n\\nBy way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. \\n\\nSince the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. \\n\\nBased on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . \\n\\nBy this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to \\nunderstand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. \\n\\nTrusting to hear from you, I remain \\n\\nRespectfully yours, \\n\\nMr. Idris Umar. \\n\\nNB:FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE REVERT BACK TO ME VIA \\nTHIS MY ALTERNATIVE MAILBOX:(idrisumar71@rediffmail.com) \\nFIND MY CELL NUMBERS 234 80 33338093. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________\\nGO.com Mail                                    \\nGet Your Free, Private E-mail at [URL]http://mail.go.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the \\nUnited Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December \\nduring the Tsunami disaster last year \\n(2004).[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] these \\ncouple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their \\nlife to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot \\nof landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As \\ntheir legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol \\nHall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they \\ndedicated their wealth to God. \\n\\nAccording to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry \\nfor the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the \\nassets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He \\ngave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the \\nwork of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a \\nmatter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two \\ntrunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the \\nSecurity Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore \\nthey registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the \\nsecurity company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold \\nBars. \\n\\nAs a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to \\ndo what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund \\nto the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by \\nthe owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked \\nGod to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the \\nchosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came \\nacross your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a \\nChristian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for \\nthings that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the \\nSecurity Company where they deposited the consignments that contained \\nthe fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security \\ncompany is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the \\nshores of my country. \\n\\nDear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly \\nand wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me \\nwith the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) \\nYour prompt response will be highly appreciated. \\n\\nYours in Christ. \\n\\nBarrister Robert Beaud. \\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Attention Plz., My name is Mr. R. Lauder, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.  Note, the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. Through well-secured channels,I have the ability to flit away the funds into a bank in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds of this nature.And to further obliterate any atom of trace to the fund, once in The Cayman Islands,I will relocate the funds to France through same well-secured established channel. Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds from France. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds in your name.And we share the funds.

I am MR. JAJASHA ALI. the Manager of auditing \\nand accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN \\nDEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m \\nUS dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who \\ndied along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nanindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, \\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after \\nI will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number,\\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication \\nand location where in the money will be remitted .\\n\\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by \\nemail which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials \\nconfirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the \\npayment Agency. I willbe handling official\\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as \\nI am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.\\n\\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\\nemail address .\\n\\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\\n\\nYours sincerely.\\n\\nMR.
