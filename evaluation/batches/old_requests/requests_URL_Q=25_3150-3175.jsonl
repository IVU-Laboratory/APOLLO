Johnson,the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US  Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. \\n \\n    It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill. \\n\\n  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than  three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand\\nas next of kin to a foreigner. \\n\\nIn appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is  for me. \\n\\n  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. \\n\\n   You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email or you call me on my direct telephone number 221 666 61 83. \\n \\n   PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT REQUEST. \\n \\n   Yours  Faithfully,\\n\\n  MR.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend, \\n\\nLet me start by introducing myself properly to you. I \\nam Alhaji Yusuf Adamah, I work with the United Bank \\nfor Africa UBA as an account officer in the Treasury/\\nCredit Control Unit. I came to know you in private search\\nfor a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential \\ntransaction, which involve the transfer of a huge sum of \\nmoney into a foriegn account requiring maximum confidence. \\n\\nI must solicit your confidence in this transaction, by virtue of \\nits nature that is utterly confidential and secret. Though I know\\nthat a transaction of this magnitude will make any one \\napprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be \\nwell at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the\\nfact that this transaction is urgent, as I will rely on your ability in\\nhandling a transaction of this nature. \\n\\nTHE NATURE OF THE PROPOSITION / TRANSACTION:\\nA foreigner by name Andreas Schranner , who is a real \\nestate and property developer by profession executed certain\\ncontract/supply with the Government of the Federal Republic\\nof Nigeria in 1998. The payment for the executed contract had \\nbeen approved and deposited with our bank in an Escrow account \\nwith us at UBA and had a closing balance as at the end of January \\n2000, which is worth ($27M) Twenty seven Million United States Dollars.\\n\\nI was his personal account officer and since the government deposited \\nthis money with us in the year 1999, We were instructed by my late \\nclient that the money be kept and secured in a security and finance firm \\nbecause it was less expensive to keep and secure the funds in the \\nsecurity firm devoid of tax payments. \\n\\nI am sad to inform you that Mr Andreas Schranner, his wife, daughter, \\ndaughter inlaw and children died in the ill fated concorde flight AF4590 \\nthat crashed into Hotelisimmo on the 31st of July 2000 in Paris-France. \\nCheck this website below: \\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] \\n\\nOur bank now expects his Next of Kin to come forward as a sole \\nbeneficiary to his assets with the bank as accordingto banking laws, \\nsuch fund which has stayed more than 5 years without any claim will be \\nterminated and be used by the bank as unclaimed fund. Mean while, as is \\npersonal account officer valuable efforts has being made by me for more than \\nthree years to get in touch with any of my late client family or relatives without \\nany success.It is because of the percieved impossibility of being able to locate \\nany of my late client Next of Kin as his wife Maria Schranner and his daughter\\nEich Andreas perished in the flight also. \\n\\nBased on this, I secretly seek advice from a fellow coleague who has being in \\nbanking for about 14 years now about this issue of my late client , he made me \\nunderstand that things like this do happen and at the end of the day the chairman \\nand board of directors of the bank will declare the funds as '' Unclaimed '' and \\nsubsequently divert it for thier personal use. In order to avert this negetive \\ndevelopment, I now seek your permission to have you stand as the Next of Kin \\nto my late client, so that the funds will be released and paid into your account as \\nthe beneficiary Next of Kin. \\n\\nI have already secured from the probate, as soon as I recieve an acknowledgement \\nof your acceptance, I will furnish you with the necessary modalities of the transaction. \\nI assure you that this transcaction is 100% risk free, and as soon as we succeed in \\ngetting this funds to your account, I shall take a trip to meet with you in your country \\nand the money will be shared on a 85% for me and 15% for you. We could go into\\njoint investment based on your advice. \\n\\nPlease forward to me on acceptance of this proposal, your private telephone and fax \\nnumber including the country code and area codes, your complete names,and \\nprivate email address for effective communication as the project will be completed \\nwithin the next 14 working days. \\n\\nPlease, treat with absolute maturity, kindness and reservation even though you are\\nnot interested to work with me, waiting to hear from you soonest.\\n\\nThanks for your anticipated response.\\n\\nBest Regards. \\n\\nAlhaji.Y.Adamah\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}
