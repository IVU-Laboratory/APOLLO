My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:\\n \\n[URL]http://www.amarillonet.com[/URL], \\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nMy late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. \\n \\nAfter the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.\\n \\nIt was while i was searching for his family records on the internet that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the \\nRussia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.\\n \\n \\nI have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. \\n\\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.\\n\\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\n\\nBarrister  Philip Wilson\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo!

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/adb/t, Mr.Gerald Smith who died in a plane crash (EgyptAir Flight 990)which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31st,1999 with other passengers on board.You can view this web site for more story of the inccident [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\nSince the death of this customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$13,000,000.00(Thirteen Million Dollars) which has been with my bank for a very long time. On this note I decided to seek for whose name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin.\\nIn view of this I got your contact through my country?s foreign trade mission after I was convinced by providence that your name could be used as the next of kin.The request of the foreigner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by thefact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalias cannot stand as the next of kin to a Foreign client\\n\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect of providing a new bank account or we can use your old accountinformation,while the rest will be for me, thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement as I am almost due for retirement.Therefore, to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as\\narranged, we must engage the services of a lawyer to apply on your behalf to the bank as a relation to the deceased.I need you to indicate in your response, your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and your complete bank information where the money will be remitted into for our mutual benefit. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send you by fax or e-mail the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as every modality and machinery for the success of this transaction have been put in place. \\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this\\nletter strictly on email for security reasons.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you.\\nYour respectfully,\\nMr. Felix Kambala.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Bri\u00e8vement, je suis une sierra l\u00e9onaise ag\u00e9e de 22 ans et la fille unique du d\u00e9funt DR Kouakou Bah Theodore. Jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort, mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'extraction d'or et de diamant dans la r\u00e9gion de Kanema en Sierra Leone. Le 6 Avril 2002 les forces militaires fid\u00e8les au gouvernement d'Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH ont envahi la mine de diamant et d'or et ont assassin\u00e9 mon p\u00e8re, le confondant avec son fr\u00e8re kouakou Sankoh qui est le d\u00e9put\u00e9 du (RUF) du r\u00e9volutionnaire FODAY SANKOH.Quand ma m\u00e8re, absente car venu me voir en c\u00f4te d'ivoire o\u00f9 j'\u00e9tudie dans une grande \u00e9cole a appris la nouvelle ,elle est retoun\u00e9e au pays malgr\u00e9 tous les risques et a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 certaines des affaires qu'elle jugeait sacr\u00e9es pour mon p\u00e8re dans notre villa de famille. Parmi les objets r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s figurait un dossier contenant des d\u00e9tails d'un d\u00e9p\u00f4t que mon p\u00e8re a fait dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 Abidjan C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Il y a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 $ 10.500.000,00 (Dix millions cinq cent mille de dollars des \u00c9tats-Unis) contenus dans une (1) bo\u00eete de tronc \u00e0 son nom. Il n'a pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 le vrai contenu de la bo\u00eete \u00e0 cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins il  a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t comme biens de famille pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. C'est l'argent que mon defunt p\u00e8re a gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la vente de l'or et de diamants pendant son temps comme Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Compte tenu du climat politique instable en Cote d\u00b4Ivoire , j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de chercher un partenaire afin d'investir cette somme hors de la C\u00f4te D'ivoire dans des domaines rentables,  c'est donc la raison pour laquelle je viens vers vous pour solliciter votre assistance et nous aider \u00e0 investir dans votre pays. La meilleure m\u00e9thode pour conclure cette transaction vue la tension politique en cote d\u00b4Ivoire, serait d'exp\u00e9dier la caisse contenant les fonds dans votre pays . La compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a la possibilit\u00e9 de nous faciliter les choses en exp\u00e9diant cette caisse dans votre pays par la voie diplomatique que j'appr\u00e9cie beaucoup. D\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e de ces fonds dans votre pays, vous allez les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et les sauvegarder et engager les d\u00e9marches pour nous aider \u00e0 venir s'\u00e9tablir dansvotre pays. Ici en raison de sa proximit\u00e9 \u00e0 notre pays et de la guerre, notrestatut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 ici ne peut pas faciliter les affaires pour nous. Nous vous demandons \u00e9galement de rechercher des affaires fiables et lucratives, de sorte que nous puissions investir sagement. Nous avons \u00e0 l'esprit de vous donner 15 % de toute la somme (10.500.000,00 millions de dollars $), et la part de 25% dans n'importe quel investissement que nous ferons au moment venu si vous acceptez de nous aider.  Cette fortune que nous vous avons indiqu\u00e9e devrait demeurer confidentielle.dans l'attente de vous lire.Au plaisir de collaborer avec vous.

Abacha, [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Please Reply to: partnerindeed@voila.fr \\n\\nGreetings from Mrs. M. Abacha,\\n\\nl am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your contact address through your country's embassy and high commissions here in Lagos Nigeria,during my research for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who i will do business with, though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever they will recommend for me for security reasons. \\n\\nI am MRS MARIAM ABACHA (A Moslem), wife and the widow of the late Nigeria Military Head of State, Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial business relationship.\\n\\nl currently have within my reach the sum of Twelve Million US Dollars (US$12,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment purposes, like Real Estates Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.  The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of  USD$12,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l a director. Right now, the new Civilian Government headed by president olusegun obasanjo have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw this US$12,000,000.00 from our  company's vault and deposited it with another Security Company for safe keeping. l have since declared our Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existedconcerning the money traceable by the government because  there is no documentation showing that we received this money from our Russian business partners.\\n\\nDue to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of (BBC World News of 12th August & 4th September 2000). You can check it through their contact website at\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nand\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nThe present civilian government in Nigeria had seized and frozen all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed in proceeding to the Security Company and claim this fund for onward invesment in your country. l proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 5% for offsetting all minor expenses incurred in the course of this Transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop all further contacts. \\n\\nAll correspondence must be by my private email address above. I will give you my particulars including my personal picture for you to know me very clearly when l hear from you. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence and keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while awaits your prompt response. I will also scan and send to you a copy of my photograph for your record keeping. Pls Note that some times to come,You might receive some messages that looks like this but you don't need to respond back to such messages because they are ikely to be our family enemies and impersonators who are trying to know the current  financial strenght of my late husband. (Sani Abacha).\\n\\nNB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family by the present civilian government headed by president olusegun obasanjo, l have decided that this transaction transaction will exist between you and my family Attorney and also my son,Abba Abacha, Therefore you can contact my son through our contact telephone numbers at: 234-80-33464921. Remember to include your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers for easy communication.

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this \\nletter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr. \\nMohammed Williams from Angola.The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza \\nWilliams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nI got your address from my random search at the net. And, I on behalf of my \\nwidowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams  decided to solicit for your assistance \\nto transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private \\nsecurity company in Johannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nIn fact, my father said, and I quote: My son, I wish to draw your attention \\nto US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States \\nDollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in \\nJohannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very \\ncommitted and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found \\nout that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy \\nhelping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to \\nforeign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and \\nI were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in \\nSouth Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and \\nshare it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million \\nEight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).\\n\\nIn case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit \\nfor assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to \\ntransfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited \\nthe box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your \\nmother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your \\nsisters.\\n\\n>From these words of my late father, you can understand that life and future \\nof my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can \\nassist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers. \\nFinancial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit \\nus certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in \\nSouth Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out \\nof South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared \\nto offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be set aside for any \\nexpenses incurred during this transaction.\\n\\nPlease note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I \\ndemand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally \\ngets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust \\nconfidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful \\nif you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm your \\ninterest through the above contact telephone numbers or email.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMOHAMMED WILLIAMS.\\n{For the family}\\n\\nAll responses should be sent to: mohammed_william4@yahoo.com\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nCould you be the guest MSN Movies presenter?

I have \\nthe courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and \\nconfidential business believing that you will never let me down either \\nnow or in future. I am MR.CHAMBERLIN KLUGMAN,the MANAGER of the bank. \\nThere is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody \\nhas operated on this account again. After going through some old files \\nin the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out \\nurgently it will be forfeited for nothing. \\nThe owner of this account is Mr. PAULTON ALLENS, a foreigner, and an \\nengineer with  D&D Engineering CO,and he died since 1990. No other \\nperson knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account \\nhas no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that \\nthis company does not know anything about this account and the amount \\ninvolved is (USD 45M)  I want to transfer the [USD45M] Forty Five \\nmillion United States Dollars into a safe foreigners account abroad , \\nbut I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner \\nbecause this money can not be approved to a local bank here, but can \\nonly be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us \\ndollars and the former owner of the account is Mr PAULTON ALLENS is a \\nforeigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise \\nas we don't know our selves before,but be sure that it is real and a \\ngenuine business. I only got your contact address through the \\ninternet,hoping that you will never let me down in this business. \\n I need your urgent reply  so that I will inform you  on the next step \\nto take I will like you to Send also your private telephone and fax \\nnumber including the full details of the account to be used for the \\ndeposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to \\nbind us together so that you can receive this money into a foreign \\naccount or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. I \\nwill fly to your country for withdrawal & sharing and other \\ninvestments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a \\nforeigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your \\nfull co-operation to make this work fine because the management is \\nready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct \\ninformation of this account, which I will give to you later \\nimmediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount \\nin strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice \\nfor our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again \\nin my life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't \\nwant to make mistake I need your strong assurance and trust. With my \\nposition now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's \\nreliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money \\nwill be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. \\nI will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this \\nmoney leaving no trace to any place. You can also come to discuss with \\nme face to face after which I will make this remittance in your \\npresence and two of us will fly to your country so at least two days \\nahead of the money \\ngoing into the ccount. \\nI will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you \\nthat you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. \\nI will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and \\nonward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate \\nclearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange  departments. At \\nthe conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \\namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties \\nmight have incurred during the process of transferring. \\nI look forward to your earliest reply. \\n\\nTHANKS AND GOD BLESS, \\n\\nYOURS SINCERELY, \\n\\nMR.CHAMBERLIN KLUGMAN. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________\\nGet your webmail @ drunkandstoned.com\\nUnlike your crack habit... it's free!\\n\\n[URL]http://www.drunkandstoned.com[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I am Mr. Michael Dohn , with Banque Internationale De L'Afrique with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited the sum of  US$7.5million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the website; [URL]www.cnn.com[/URL] But, since that year after the death of our client, we have not had anybody that comes for the claims of this money as the next of kin to our client. A situation I have monitored closely with my position in our bank. \\n\\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before and after his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past years now, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now humbly solicit for your assistance in this issue. I wish to present you as the next of kin to this our client so as to claim out this money, before it is remmited into the fedral account where other people may aswell claim it directly without going to this lenght. I have taken every necessary precautionary measures  concerning this issue and arrangement has been concluded by me in achieving this goal, provided you will follow my instructions in the process. I am only waiting for your response to enable me move the funds to your agreed safe account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed also provided you give me your assistance and support.\\n\\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences. \\n\\nThank you in anticipation of your urgent response to my request stating your wish in this deal.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nMr Michael Dohn. \\n+228-917-87-92..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}
