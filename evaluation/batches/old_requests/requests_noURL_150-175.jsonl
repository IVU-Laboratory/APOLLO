I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou himself is \"dude\", and some package has hardwired a path in his build directory.

Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking that  it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in  the new code because we're trying to use the sequences. On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache  when that happens anyway. Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a  [file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.

(It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. This one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@      set seq {}      set rseq {}      foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { +\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { +\t    # just ignore anything bogus +\t    continue; +\t}  \tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]  \tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {  \t    lappend seq $parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\" if you like, but I don't think an error is needed). But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck a \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before. If you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it, I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it. And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway, so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \\r instead. So I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here.   \\r continues to work of course. And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G). Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the \"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don't think we really need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then). kre --- select.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@      bindtags $w [list $w Entry]      bind $w \t{SelectTypein %W %A}      bind $w \t{SelectToggle %W } +    bind $w \t{SelectPrev %W }      bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W} +    bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W %A}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@      append select(sel) $a      Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"      if ![info exists select(folder)] { -\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow +\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }      }  }  proc SelectBackSpace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@  proc SelectToggle {w} {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} { +\t    SelectTypein $w + +\t    return +\t}  \tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]  \tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"      } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@      }      Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"  } +proc SelectPrev {w} { +    global select +    if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tSelectTypein $w \"-\" +    } else { +\tcatch { +\t    incr select(sel) -1 +\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +\t} +        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\" +    } +}  proc SelectComplete { w } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@  \tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"      }  } -proc SelectReturn { w } { +proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tif {$a != {}} { +\t    SelectTypein $w $a +\t    return +\t}  \tif [info exists select(match)] {  \t    set select(sel) $select(match)  \t    unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@  \tunset select(folder)      }      $select(entry) configure -state disabled +    Exmh_Status \"\"      Exmh_Focus  }  proc SelectClear { w } { _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

The written words are then translated\\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \\n\\n\"It went reasonably well half the time,\" said Mr Frederking, though it was\\nslow in translating phrases. \\n\\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\\nfield. \\n\\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\\nwork with further research and development. \\n\\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\\nUniversity. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \\n \\n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The\\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\\n successful breeding season over the winter.\" \\n \\n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\\n station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the\\n cape, may have lost up to third of its population. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

To me, it looks \\nlike a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.\\n\\nIf I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the \\nHabeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  \\nThen I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As \\nlong as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is \\ndirecting people to, I'm home free.\\n\\nSince I can set up spamassassin to I don't \"lose\" any email, what do I gain \\nby making it easier for spam to get through??\\n- -- \\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRobin Lynn Frank---Director of Operations---Paradigm, Omega, LLC\\n[URL]http://paradigm-omega.com[/URL]              [URL]http://paradigm-omega.net[/URL]\\n 2002.
