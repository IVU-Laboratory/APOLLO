I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of\\nauditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an\\nabandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to\\none of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in\\nnovember 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his\\nnext of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot\\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation\\nto the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but\\nunfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation\\ndied alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my\\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and\\nI don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed\\nBill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money\\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered\\ninto the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is\\noccasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a\\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,\\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set\\naside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for\\nme . There after I will visit your country with my family for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of\\nkin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account\\nnumber,\\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where in the money will be remitted .\\n\\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or\\nby email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide\\nmaterials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment\\nformalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official\\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international\\nresponsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction\\nprovided you display maturity.\\n\\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\\nemail address .\\n\\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\\n\\nYours sincerely.\\n\\nMR.

I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal, now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal.   I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October  1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS: ([URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB.   My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.   This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.    Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.   Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.   I await your reply. Mrs. Saleh Galal\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \\nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \\ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \\nrewards for both of us.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \\nThousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of \\nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \\nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \\nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \\nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as \"unclaimed fund\". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \\n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \\nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\\n\\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \\nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \\nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \\ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \\nof your reply,\\n\\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \\nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \\nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \\nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \\nreceive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nibrahim mussa,\\nBill and exchange manager,\\nAfrican Development bank ADB\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Live.com : le nouveau moteur de recherche par Messenger! \\n[URL]http://www.windowslive.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal\\n Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Regime of\\n 1993-\\n 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and\\n trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is\\n presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite\\n surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your\\n contact from a business site on the internet and following the\\n information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of\\n assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency\\n required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the\\n country. During the time my father was in the government with the late\\n General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in\\n several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the\\n deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation\\n of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to\\n embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put\\n a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s government to\\n retain\\n power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum\\n Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies\\n Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news,\\n you would understand better. During this period my father was able to\\n make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.\\n The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the\\n money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman,\\n Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets\\n were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive\\n governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and\\n repatriated\\n from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the\\n money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million\\n Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign\\n account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private\\n security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the\\n Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating\\n agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M,\\n which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to\\n lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS\\n (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also\\n the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.\\n Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father\\n has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my\\n Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure\\n that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.\\n With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on\\n this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough\\n homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to\\n the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the\\n modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our\\n safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be\\n absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.\\n If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email\\n for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.\\n All my fathers\\\\\\\\\\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the\\n pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"it is at the time\\n of problems that you know your true friends\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So long as you keep\\n everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your\\n assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds\\n after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable\\n business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this\\n happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source\\n of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in\\n assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and\\n positive response.\\n\\n BEST REGARDS,\\n\\n\\n MR TUNDA USENI\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\nFree Email Service\\n[URL]http://www.zapo.net[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you.\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration of four years (4yrs) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. \\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem ,all that is required from you at\\nthis stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been\\nmade the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.\\n\\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.\\n\\nShould you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address  and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below  (pui1900@business1.com)  and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\nYour earliest response to this letter will be\\nappreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Cheung Pui\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nCorreo enviado por El Club de Tratlon de Tres Cantos\\n- [URL]http://www.traitlontrescantos.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just \ufffd3.00 (\ufffd5/$5.00).\\n\\nIn March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over \ufffd10,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking \"What if it actually works?\" For the sake of \ufffd3 isn't it worth a go!\\nI put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than \ufffd3 (\ufffd5/$5). \\n\\nWhat did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! \\nThe business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than \ufffd10,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). \\nThis must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! \\n\\nPlease do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. \\n\\nThis program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! \\nThis program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. \\n\\nYou will need:\\n\ufffd\tAn email address \\n\ufffd\tA Premier or Business PayPal account with at least \ufffd3 (\ufffd5/$5) deposited in it \\n\ufffd\t30 minutes of your time \\n\\nPayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. \\n\\nTo get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! \\n\\nHere's what you need to do:\\nSTEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.\\nhttp:/[URL]www.paypal.com[/URL] \\n \\nSTEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a \ufffd3 (\ufffd5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: \\n\" Please add me to your mailing list. \" \\nBe certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under \"SEND MONEY\" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! \\nHere's the current list: \\n\\n1.\thurst_l@lineone.net\\n2.\tadmin@makinscentz.com\\n3.\ttracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk\\n4.\tcharlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk\\n5.\tkingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEP 3: Once you've sent a \ufffd3 (\ufffd5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have \"Opted In\". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. \\n\\nThe e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).\\n\\nDelete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)\\nNo 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! \\nA word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! \\n\\nWhen you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. \\nAs long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. \\nIf you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). \\nOut of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. \\nOut of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. \\nOut of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! \\nNow, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive \ufffd3 (\ufffd5/$5) from each of them, that's; \ufffd9,375 (3,125 x \ufffd3(\ufffd5/$5).\\n \\nSo, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. \\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just 3.00 (5/$5.00).\\n\\nIn March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over 10,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking \"What if it actually works?\" For the sake of 3 isn't it worth a go!\\nI put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than 3 (5/$5). \\n\\nWhat did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! \\nThe business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than 10,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). \\nThis must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! \\n\\nPlease do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. \\n\\nThis program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! \\nThis program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. \\n\\nYou will need:\\n\tAn email address \\n\tA Premier or Business PayPal account with at least 3 (5/$5) deposited in it \\n\t30 minutes of your time \\n\\nPayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. \\n\\nTo get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! \\n\\nHere's what you need to do:\\nSTEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.\\nhttp:/[URL]www.paypal.com[/URL] \\n \\nSTEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a 3 (5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: \\n\" Please add me to your mailing list. \" \\nBe certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under \"SEND MONEY\" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! \\nHere's the current list: \\n\\n1.\thurst_l@lineone.net\\n2.\tadmin@makinscentz.com\\n3.\ttracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk\\n4.\tcharlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk\\n5.\tkingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEP 3: Once you've sent a 3 (5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have \"Opted In\". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. \\n\\nThe e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).\\n\\nDelete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)\\nNo 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! \\nA word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! \\n\\nWhen you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list.

And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive 3 (5/$5) from each of them, that's; 9,375 (3,125 x 3(5/$5).\\n \\nSo, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money!

After the United States  and Iraqi war, our \\nclient Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in \\nIraq and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 12 calendar \\nmonths, with a value of ten million five hundred thausand usd only in my \\nbranch.Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even in the first \\nquater of this year.Again another notification was sent and still no \\nresponse came from him. We later found out that the Deputy Governor has been \\nassasinated in Baghdad.\\nThe websites below is a proof  and verification of the news about his  \\ndeath:\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org[/URL]\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Hatem Kamil Abdul \\nFatah did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the \\npaper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he \\n  was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, \\nten million five hundred usd$ is still lying in my bank and no one will ever \\ncome forward to claim it. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is \\nthat I will like you as a neutral person to stand in as the next of kin to \\nHatem Kamil Abdul Fatah so that you will be able to receive his funds with \\nmy aid as the insider.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        FROM MR FRED KUMA.\\nREPUBLIC OF BENIN.\\nWEST AFRICA.\\nTEL:229 08 69 05.\\n\\n\\nDear Friend,\\n\\nI am MR FRED KUMA, the director in charge of auditing and accounting\\nsection of Continental Trust Bank cotonou republic of benin in west Africa\\nwith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business\\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the\\ntransaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came\\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in\\na plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrik\\nInternational with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola\\nwith registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has\\nbeen dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in\\nour custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nAlthough personally, I keep this information secret within myself and\\npartners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and\\nsuccessful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M\\n(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars).\\n\\nAs it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information\\nthrough my a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in\\nCotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and\\ncapable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.\\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the\\nbonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer\\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and\\nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your\\ninterest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this\\ngreat business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in\\nthis country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign\\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time\\nof transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it\\nwill require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next\\nof kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need\\nthe money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due\\nverification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank\\nwhere the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank\\naccount.\\n\\nMay I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I\\nhave made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the\\nbank before contacting you.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you\\nwill be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will\\nbe set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of\\ntransfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.\\n\\nPlease, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in\\nservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with\\nyou.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you\\nconfirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country\\nfor subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously\\nindicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you\\nadvice us to invest in.\\n\\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to\\nchampion this transaction with me.\\n\\nI suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal mobile\\nphone 229 08 69 05 stating your wish in this deal.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDR FRED KUMA\\n\\nTEL:229 08 69 05.\\nALTERNATIVE EMAIL:\\nefftee2002@eudoramail.com\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nCe service de mailing vous est offert par [URL]http://www.freesurf.fr[/URL]\\nFreeSurf, votre acces ADSL a partir de 29 euros/mois\\n[URL]http://www.freesurf.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
