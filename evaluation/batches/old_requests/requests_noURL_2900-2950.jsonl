Unfortunately, my client Mrs. Stella Olusegun \\nObasanjo died on Saturday October 22nd, 2005. For details of her death \\nvisit:\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n          Before the untimely death of my client, she had through a security \\ncompany here in Nigeria moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was to \\nproceed to Netherlands from Spain where she went just for medial check-up  \\nimmediately after the check-up to complete arrangements and have this money \\nDeposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the \\nfunds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should \\nbe claimed by the depositor (My Client) or her next of kin within 14 working \\ndays, thinking that they are to take the funds just the way some   \\nsecurities companies did to one of our late presidents wife and her family \\n(Mrs. Maryam Abacha)  else the fund will be forfeited to the state, with \\nsuch the husband wouldn\ufffdt like or wish to hear this from the press or any \\none. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund \\nout of the Finance Company, I will be doing the greatest injustice to my \\nlate client and her family. This is why I decided for you to stand in as a \\nnext of kin or her business partner who was supposed to receive the funds \\nfor investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only \\nperson who has access to my client's documents. The Finance firm has just \\nsent a reminder to my client through me, informing her of the maturity of \\nher fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is \\nsubject to negotiations. I need the following information from you. Your \\nfull names,address,telephone and Fax numbers. Also Copy of your \\nIdentification.

I am Mr. Michael Dohn , with Banque Internationale De L'Afrique with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited the sum of  US$7.5million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the website; [URL]www.cnn.com[/URL] But, since that year after the death of our client, we have not had anybody that comes for the claims of this money as the next of kin to our client. A situation I have monitored closely with my position in our bank. \\n\\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before and after his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past years now, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now humbly solicit for your assistance in this issue. I wish to present you as the next of kin to this our client so as to claim out this money, before it is remmited into the fedral account where other people may aswell claim it directly without going to this lenght. I have taken every necessary precautionary measures  concerning this issue and arrangement has been concluded by me in achieving this goal, provided you will follow my instructions in the process. I am only waiting for your response to enable me move the funds to your agreed safe account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed also provided you give me your assistance and support.\\n\\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences. \\n\\nThank you in anticipation of your urgent response to my request stating your wish in this deal.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nMr Michael Dohn. \\n+228-917-87-92..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

In my department, I discovered an abandoned consignment worth over sum of US$12Million dollars (Twelve Million US dollars) in file that belongs to our foreign customer,    LATE MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. Below is a website which I will appreciate you going through to read the information.    [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]   Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all effort has proved abortive.   The reason why I am contacting you is based on trust to enable me present you as the next-of-kin to him so this consignment will be released to you for safety and subsequent disbursement.    Nobody has come to our company for claiming of the consignment.    It will be easy to convince the company since I am in possession of the necessary legalised documents that backs-up the consignment and which will present you as the rightful next-of-kin to the deceased customer. I don't want this consignment to go into company,s treasury as unclaimed bill.    The company laws and guidelines stipulates that if such consignment remains unclaimed after seven years, the company will confiscate it.    The request for a foreigner as next-of-kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that late ANDREAS was a foreigner and any indigene cannot stand as next-of-kin to a foreigner.   All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I agree that 25% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of your assistance , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction, another 5% to help the less privilege and to assist the charity organisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 65% will be for me.    Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate release of this consignment, you must apply to the company as the relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your complete information, complete name, postal address, occupation, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the consignment will be release to.    Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the Application you will send to the company to seek the release of the consignment to you. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required Arrangements have been made. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail. My email address i: johnamaneclarke1@aim.com   Or you can send your number for me to call you. Trusting to hear from you immediately for more detailed discussion.    Regards,   John Amane Clarke.

Bolkiah, the wife of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former\\nFinance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf\\nIsland. I did not mean to amplify my extended royal family history, which\\nhas already been disseminated by the international media during the\\ncontroversial dispute that erupted between my husband and his stepbrother,\\nthe sultan of Brunei; His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin\\nWaddaulah.\\n\\nAs you may know from the international media, the sultan; His Majesty\\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin Waddaulah had accused my husband of\\nfinancial mismanagement and impropriety of US$76.8 million dollars. This\\nwas as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my husband's\\ncompany Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment\\nCompany to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my\\nhusband is in jail now, his bank accounts and private properties including\\na crude oil export refinery have been confiscated by the sultanate.\\n\\nFurthermore, during this unfortunate period I was advised to evacuate my\\nimmediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from\\nthe sultan and his security operatives, but luck ran against me on my\\nattempt to escape. The Sultan now keeps me under house arrest and I have\\nno access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I\\nam sending you this mail.\\n\\nBefore my In-castration, I was able to dispatch the sum of Fourteen\\nMillion United States Dollars (US$14M) in cash under special arrangement\\ninto the custody of a Private security and Trustee company for safe\\nkeeping abroad. This action was on the orders of my husband to me to\\nenable us start a new life. The money was packaged carefully into two and\\nkept in trunks. Hence I seek your good assistance to retrieve this money\\nand further invest into profitable investment in your country to\\nfacilitate future survival for my family abroad. I have decided to offer\\n20% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation.\\n\\nPlease I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust\\nwhile looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of\\nthis business transaction.\\n\\nMany Thanks & May Allah blessing remain with you, Amen.\\n\\nI remain yours sincerely\\n\\nPrincess Fayad .W.

I have children with my husband Jose, Jacqueline and Jude.Two sons and a daugther.This mail may be coming to you as a surprise or an article but it is very real.\\n\\nI gave the mail to my daugther Jude to send the mail to any contacts she sees and may be a God fearing person will listen to our plight.I will want you as the receiver to read through it and think very well if you can help or render us any assistance. My husband Joseph Ejercito estrada was elected as the 13th President of the Philippines in May 1998 by the people of Philippines due to his popularity in the film industry made him to win the largest popularity in the history of election in Philippines.He has attain the position of Senate in 1987,then vice-president in May 1992 and later become the president 1998.My husband became mayor of his hometown, San Juan in 1969 but it was 1972 that he had a string of public successes. My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor.\\n\\n My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file!\\n before my husband in the impeachment trial; \\n\\n1. Gov. Luis Singson, a longtime friend of my husband, said he provided the my husband with more than $8 million in payoffs from illegal gambling and $2.7 million from tobacco taxes. \\n\\n2. Witnesses testify one of an account in the Philippines third largest bank held millions of dollars in bribes collected by my husband. Equitable PCI Bank President George Go resigns. The banks senior vice president, Clarissa Ocampo, said she saw my husband sign a false name to documents withdrawing $10 million from a secret personal account. \\n\\n3. On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial. \\n\\n\\n4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death. Presently !\\nlife has not been easy for my children and I,my travelling documents have been seized by the government and they restricted me and my children to have access to my husband.\\n\\n Haven seen the way things are going with us.He decided to let me know that he deposited some money with Bank in Europe.He said that he deposited the sum of twenty Million dollars $20,000,000 in Banesto Bank Valencia Spain.Now I want to start a new life with the money.I want to invest the money outside Philippines.

On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.\\nAfter about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .\\nPlease do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will \\nbe of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of \\n7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.\\n\\nI therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your \\nurgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it \\nwill be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of \\nmovement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.\\n\\nThis money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband \\nand a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands \\nshare .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my \\nhusbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our \\naccounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and \\nthe arrest of my First son.\\n\\nIn view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of \\nour finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the \\nmoney in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this \\nfund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we \\nhave such funds.\\n\\nFurther more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years \\nfollowing the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder \\nand corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after \\nthe president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he \\nis still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital \\ndocuments.\\n\\nDue to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my \\nfamily,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in \\ntransferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to \\ninvest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist \\nme.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.\\n\\nI am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere \\nlike yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start \\nall over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over \\nto your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please \\ndo not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in \\ntotal trust and confidence.\\n\\nPlease kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal \\ntelephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the \\ntotal sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during \\nthecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until \\nwe can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent \\nto our free movement by the Senegal Government.\\n\\nI will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.\\nYour URGENT response is needed.\\n\\nRegards and God Bless you.\\n\\nMrs.Estelle Mamadou .\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am (AZIZ KOFFI) a seniorstaff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got yourcontact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured ofyour capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity wheni prayed  to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003\u00a0\u00a0) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death,  \u00a0 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased asindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at theplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. \u00a0 \u00a0The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will betransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visityour country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you asarranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of  the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank accountnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receiptof your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of theapplication I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on my number 00226 76 17 22 04.immediately as soonas you receive this letter. reply me with this e mail address aziz_koffi@latinmail.com immediately. Yours faithfully,AZIZ KOFFI \u00a0 POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as toenable thetransfer to move very smoothly in to the account you willprove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call meimmediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always..........................................................................................MSN Messenger  : appels gratuits de PC  PC partout dans le monde !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

A. E. I \\nwrite you this proposal in good faith, believing that I \\ncan trust you with the information I am about to reveal to \\nyou.\\n\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business \\nproposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign \\nOil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM \\nCORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) \\nfor 36 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 \\n(Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in \\nmy bank and I happen to be his account officer before I \\nwas moved to my present position recently.\\n\\n  Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as \\nwell the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the \\nmaturity date so I sent a routine notification to his \\nforwarding address but the letter was returned \\nundelivered.\\n\\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it \\nwas again returned and finally I discovered from his \\ncontract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. \\nKhalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand \\nof Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of \\nhis trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of \\nleaking information to the Americans. On further \\ninvestigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family \\nwife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was \\nthe reason why he did not declare any next of kin or \\nrelation in all his official documents, including his Bank \\nDeposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any\\nWILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and \\nplaced under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank \\nmanagement since no one have heard from the owner since \\n2003.\\n\\n  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have \\nmade so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am \\nthe only one that have the information.\\nWith the recent change of government in my country and \\nwith their efforts to support the United Nations in \\ncheckmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this \\nyear, the government will pass a new financial control law \\nwhich will give the government authority to interrogate \\naccount owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the \\nsource of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism \\nsupport. If I do not move this money out of the country \\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will \\ndefinitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot \\nprovide the account owner to explain the source of the \\nmoney. I cannot directly transfer out this money without \\nthe help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting \\nyou for an assistance.\\n\\n  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with \\nmy present position and status in the bank as Head of \\nRetail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the \\nrelease of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the \\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information \\nconcerning the account, which I shall give you. All \\ndocuments to enable you claim this fund will be carefully \\nworked out and there is practically no risk involved, the \\ntransaction will be executed under a legitimate \\narrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, \\nbeside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\n\\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you \\nwish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both \\nparties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact \\nme as soon as you receive this message so we can go over \\nthe details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless \\nyou.\\n\\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send \\nyou copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser \\nwhen the deposit was made for your perusal.\\nI wait your urgent reply through my private emailaddress:\\n\\nRegards,\\nMr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.\\n=================================================================\\nIkuti lomba Puisi Online dan Desain Kartu Elektronik\\nKeterangan lebih lanjut, silakan buka\\n[URL]http://www.plasa.com[/URL]\\n=================================================================\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
