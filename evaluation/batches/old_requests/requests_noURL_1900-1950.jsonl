I think this should be split up into different\\nnumbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can\\nget different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From\\nnames that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or\\nmore digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a\\nsingle digit, just the sake of completeness.\\n\\nHere is what I got:\\n\\nOVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME\\n  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)\\n100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)\\n  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6\\n  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5\\n  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4\\n  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3\\n  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2\\n  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1\\n\\nI should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably\\nbecause so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo!

all-image or mostly-image spam that's\\ngetting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use\\nof IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the\\nimages in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the\\ntotal number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that\\nlooks at the longest total run of consecutive images\\n(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).\\n\\n===============\\n\\nThe total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of\\nHTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height\\nproperties, then multiply them together and add the result to the\\nrunning total.\\n\\nOVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME\\n  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00

And the Perl error message is very clear: \\n\"ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \\nMakefile.PL line 2.\" \\n \\n> Because it never gets chance to reach a \"WriteMakefile\" line with a  \\n> PREREQ_PM => { ExtUtils::MakeMaker => 5.45 } option. So the CPAN shell  \\n> can't automatically upgrade this module. I cannot think of any way  \\n> around this. \\n \\nI could think of a solution: We could remove the \"use\" line and add the \\nversion to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines \\n  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; \\n  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); \\nto do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl \\nMakefile.PL` will die with a \"Uncaught exception from user code: \\nExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \\nMakefile.PL line 103.\" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if \\nCPAN will run the make anyway... \\n \\n> To add insult to injury, the PM_FILTER part gets run during pm_to_blib,  \\n> which would be fine, except ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't let you write a  \\n> MY::pm_to_blib - it's non-overridable! So even though we could  \\n> potentially copy the 5.45 ExtUtils::Install::pm_to_blib code somewhere  \\n> into the spamassassin codebase (I tried that first), we can't cause the  \\n> Makefile to call our code :-( \\n \\nWe could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean \\napproach but could work. \\n \\nWe can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We \\nalready have a useless line \"pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made\" there. Adding \\nsome commands in this section gives some make warnings (\"Makefile:933: \\nwarning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: \\nignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'\") but does work. Not a very good \\nsolution either. \\n \\n> So I'm *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45  \\n> usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and  \\n> really hope we can find another way. \\n \\nThe \"use MakeMaker::...\" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok \\nto require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA \\ninstallation. But that's just my opinion ;-) \\n \\nI'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution.

Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff. 2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5 for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's the problem! 3. try \"perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null\" to allow bots to build it.

The only two Precedence: > headers I've seen (aside from one or two odd messages) are \"bulk\" and > \"list\".  Adding a \"spam\" header makes sense given the convention. I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most  Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to  mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these  special, too. [1] says: | Autoresponses should always contain the header |          Precedence: junk | Notice the spelling of \"prec-e-dence\". In particular, count the number of | n:s (and a:s and s:es, if you're totally agraphic and/or from the United | States).

A number of new standards\\nand commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing\\nWeb-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the\\nrange and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.\\n\\nThe goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web\\ndesign, software engineering, and information technology communities to\\ndiscuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and\\ntool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.\\nExpertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and\\nexperience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing\\nplatforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and\\nInternet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation\\nof form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the\\nWeb.\\n\\nWSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related\\nto exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not\\nlimited to):\\n\\n*   Migrating to Web services\\n*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product\\ncontrol\\n*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable\\n*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure\\n*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple\\nplatforms\\n*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as\\narchitecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites\\n*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution\\n\\nWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software\\nMaintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event\\nfocused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of\\n\"maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems\" nicely compliments WSE\\n2002's overall theme and goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I took some time out to make  RPMs of GStreamer for it. All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt  repository in a new \"redhat-80-i386\" directory. The repository for dependencies is again called \"deps\", and the one for  the gstreamer rpms is \"redhat\", because this time around the base distro  contains all the necessary packages. A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at [URL]http://thomas.apestaart.org[/URL] Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms : a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't  have a -devel package for it yet b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve. Here are the errors: INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0:  undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin  \"/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so\" INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so:  undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0 I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib  reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must  be something straightforward that should fix this.

People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote.
