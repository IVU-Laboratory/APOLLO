The fake site was used to squeeze\\n more money out of people they had already hooked. \\n \\n The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,\\n (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being\\n taken in by the fake website. \\n \\n The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a\\n share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African\\n nations. \\n \\n NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would\\n otherwise spot the scam. \\n \\n Convincing site \\n \\n News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an\\n unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out\\n their victims. \\n\\n A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had \"the\" in\\n front of the bank's name. \\n \\n \"I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,\" said the NCIS\\n spokesman. \"It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced\\n online.\" \\n \\n Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people\\n behind it have not been caught. \\n \\n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \\n \\n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \\n\\n Domain games \\n \\n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \\n \\n The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\\n crimes. \\n \\n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \\n \\n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\\n it. \\n \\n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \\n \\n Cutting edge fraud \\n \\n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\\n legitimacy. \\n \\n \\n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\\n \\n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\\n place of the certificates. \\n \\n \"To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\\n technology,\" said the spokesman. \\n \\n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\\n Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. \\n \\n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\\n been deposited in their name. \\n \\n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \\n \\n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \\n \\n Modern gloss \\n \\n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\\n old cons a modern gloss. \\n \\n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \\n \\n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\\n true, undoubtedly is. \\n \\n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\\n service Paypal. \\n \\n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \\n \\n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in \"AllowDuplicated\",  meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same  time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one  version available. 'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it... --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer. > like mplayer not working also and gives black screen This is not normal though...

Programs such as mozilla and various others use these\\nfunctions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary\\ncode or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.\\n\\nThese new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory\\nleaks in reading image functions.\\n\\nSince most applications which display images use libpng, this affects\\nmany applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red\\nCarpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.\\n\\nXimian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris\\npackages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,\\nthey will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade\\nlibpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2.

This would be distro\\nspecific, anyway.\\n\\nI am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script\\nchanges. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.\\n\\nI do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are\\npicked up by silo.

The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM\\non shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or\\nkeyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power\\nswitch hidden at the back of the case.\\n\\nI think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is\\n/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down\\nproperly.\\n\\n- Matthew\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\\n[URL]http://uk.my.yahoo.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo,  and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it. As far as I remember the problem I was having was  that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's  RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,  and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,  and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.

BUGTRAQ SUMMARY\\n-------------------\\n1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5363\\nRemote: Yes\\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used\\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\\nSendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\\nsystems.\\n\\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of\\nOpenSSL.\\n\\nWhen initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the\\nclient and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies\\nin the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the\\nSSLv2 protocol.\\n\\nA malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a\\nmalformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in\\nexecution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker\\ngaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may\\nresult in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of\\nservice condition.\\n\\nThe consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the\\napplication using OpenSSL.\\n\\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\\n\\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\\nvulnerability.\\n\\n2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5345\\nRemote: Yes\\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\nAbyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is\\nmaintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows\\noperating systems, as well as Linux.\\n\\nA vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a\\nMicrosoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a\\nrequest such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.\\n\\nThe vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'\\ncharacters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request\\nfollowed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an\\nerror page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.\\n\\nAn attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,\\npotentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.\\n\\n3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5347\\nRemote: Yes\\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\ndotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It\\nis designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.\\n\\ndotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass\\nauthentication and gain administrative access to the software.\\n\\nThis may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'\\nvalue either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,\\nthe attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1\\nand submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also\\nsubmit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to\\n1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the\\nproject management system.\\n\\nThis problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to\\nauthenticate the user.\\n\\n4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5362\\nRemote: Yes\\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used\\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\\nSendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\\nsystems.\\n\\nA vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects\\nSSLv3 session IDs.\\n\\nWhen initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike\\nexchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with\\na unique session ID.\\n\\nReportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a\\nclient from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the\\nremote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,\\nremote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.\\n\\nAn attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute\\nmalicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.\\n\\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\\n\\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\\nvulnerability.\\n\\n5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5342\\nRemote: Yes\\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\nphpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and\\nbackended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and\\nLinux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.\\n\\nGender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a\\ngender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been\\nreported in this mod.\\n\\nA malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating\\ntheir profile.

William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability\\nBugTraq ID: 5367\\nRemote: No\\nDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM\\nRelevant URL:\\n[URL]http://www.securityfocus.com[/URL]\\nSummary:\\n\\nsuper is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar\\nfunctionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux\\nand Unix variant operating systems.\\n\\nsuper is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to\\nincorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is\\npossible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the\\nvulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to\\noverwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.\\n\\nThe vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due\\nto an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super\\nconfiguration file will still be able to execute code with root\\nprivileges.\\n\\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute\\narbitrary instructions with root privileges.\\n\\n10.

It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.\\n\\nReportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised\\nrecently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the\\nsource code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the\\nopenssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July\\n31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.\\n\\nThe trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say\\nthat the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan\\nprocess is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed\\nthe trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan\\nwill then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified\\naddress is attempted once every hour.\\n\\n'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan\\nto respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly\\nprobable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable\\nsystems.\\n\\nThe following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:\\nftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\\nftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\\nftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\\n\\nIt is not known whether other sites are affected as well.\\n\\nFreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information.

(We did consider running Linux md RAID on the disks but RAID > gives you no protection against slips of the finger) Do I get beaten round the head for saying \"floppy\"? Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this might slow you down by all of 60 seconds. Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that basically says \"boot /dev/hda1\" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the resulting \"bootable image\" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a bootp and tftp server somewhere.... hth, Ronan. --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

Well, if you have a Windows, SCO, or AIX box, (generally anything BUT Redhat Linux) that'd be the site I'd send you to, to get it installed.  I've been there for the same reason, under SCO.

Not by choice mind you :-( In short, \"I'm involved in making a TV program \"The New Road\" (which will be on TG4) at the moment, and I saw that there'll be a Linux Beer Hike in Doolin this year.
