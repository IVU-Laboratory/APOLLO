Fair enough. > What I'd recommend in your case [...] Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-) What I've done instead is to create a tiny little \"kernel.spec\" that installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have thought of this approach sooner. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec  that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that  freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind,  including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will  consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation. The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a  conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it  is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If  the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using  \"uname -p\", while %{krpm} is left undefined. The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that  kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If  the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have  retained the sources in the expected place.) Again, I realize that I'm operating \"off warrantee\" by not using a Red  Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not  too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this  message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future. --Boundary_(ID_KtnWPrcWHTTzQa7OHxPjiA) Content-type: video/mng; name=diffs Content-transfer-encoding: base64 Content-disposition: inline; filename=diffs LS0tIGFsc2EtZHJpdmVyLnNwZWMub3JpZwkyMDAyLTEwLTAxIDEzOjExOjQ0LjAwMDAwMDAw MCAtMDcwMAorKysgYWxzYS1kcml2ZXIuc3BlYwkyMDAyLTEwLTAyIDAwOjM4OjIyLjAwMDAw MDAwMCAtMDcwMApAQCAtOCw3ICs4LDEyIEBACiAlaWYgJSh1bmFtZSAtciB8IGdyZXAgLWMg c21wKQogCSV7ZXhwYW5kOiUlZGVmaW5lIGtzbXAgLXNtcH0KICVlbmRpZgotJWRlZmluZQlr YXJjaAkJJShycG0gLXEgLS1xZiAnJSV7YXJjaH0nIGtlcm5lbCV7P2tzbXB9LSV7a3ZlcnNp b259KQorJWlmICUocnBtIC1xIGtlcm5lbCV7P2tzbXB9LSV7a3ZlcnNpb259ID4vZGV2L251 bGw7IGVjaG8gJD8pCisJJWRlZmluZQlrYXJjaAkJJSh1bmFtZSAtcCkKKyVlbHNlCisJJWRl ZmluZSBrcnBtCQkxCisJJWRlZmluZQlrYXJjaAkJJShycG0gLXEgLS1xZiAnJSV7YXJjaH0n IGtlcm5lbCV7P2tzbXB9LSV7a3ZlcnNpb259KQorJWVuZGlmCiAlZGVmaW5lCWtyZWx2ZXIJ CSUoZWNobyAle2t2ZXJzaW9ufSB8IHRyIC1zICctJyAnXycpCiAKIFN1bW1hcnk6IFRoZSBB ZHZhbmNlZCBMaW51eCBTb3VuZCBBcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUgKEFMU0EpIGJhc2UgZmlsZXMuCkBA IC0yNSw3ICszMCw4IEBACiBCdWlsZFJvb3Q6ICV7X3RtcHBhdGh9LyV7bmFtZX0tJXt2ZXJz aW9ufS1yb290CiBCdWlsZEFyY2g6ICV7a2FyY2h9CiBSZXF1aXJlczogYWxzYS1rZXJuZWwg PSAle3ZlcnNpb259LCAvc2Jpbi9kZXBtb2QKLUJ1aWxkUmVxdWlyZXM6IGtlcm5lbC1zb3Vy Y2UgPSAle2t2ZXJzaW9ufSwgTUFLRURFVgorJXs/a3JwbTpCdWlsZFJlcXVpcmVzOiBrZXJu ZWwtc291cmNlID0gJXtrdmVyc2lvbn19CitCdWlsZFJlcXVpcmVzOiBNQUtFREVWCiAKICVk ZXNjcmlwdGlvbgogVGhlIEFkdmFuY2VkIExpbnV4IFNvdW5kIEFyY2hpdGVjdHVyZSAoQUxT QSkgcHJvdmlkZXMgYXVkaW8gYW5kIE1JREkK --Boundary_(ID_KtnWPrcWHTTzQa7OHxPjiA)-- _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I \\n have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, \\n like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is \\n $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 \\n bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. \\n\\n-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't \\n get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be \\n a great time to do this. \\n\\n-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find \\n a cheaper long-distance plan.\\n\\n-Document everything that I give to charity, including the \\n clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. \\n\\n-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the \\n house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). \\n\\nHave any tips of your own?

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\\n\\nOctober 2, 2002\\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\\n\\n\\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \\n\\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\\nsubject. \\n\\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \\n\\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \\n\\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\\n\"There's a study from the World Health Organization, this\\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\\nbrunets.\" \\n\\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \\n\\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \\n\\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\\nendangered species. \\n\\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\\nremained unclear which one. \\n\\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\\nBritain's domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\\nup,\" he said. \\n\\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\\nto the World Health Organization. \\n\\n\"We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the\\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\\nGerman news agency.\" \\n\\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\\norganization was referring to. \\n\\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Find your IT\\ntalent solution today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nI don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all,\\nmetaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written\\nwell, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll\\ndepart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining\\na recent metaphor.\\n\\nI'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at\\nthe average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude,\\nthough, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of\\nenthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open\\nsource worlds that I don't like or believe in.\\n\\nTake, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (\"Gnu's Not Unix\"),\\nHURD (\"Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons\"), WINE (\"Wine Is Not an Emulator\"),\\neven PHP (\"PHP Hypertext Processor\") - all carry on the tradition of recursion\\nin the Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.\\n\\nSo it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could\\nonly have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the\\nedition of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time\\nover the course of a year talking about what's _wrong_ with our system than\\nwhat's right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get\\nwould be a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my\\ncomments or those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right?\\nPeople would disagree with an article that said we spend much time\\ndisagreeing. This, of course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical\\nway - the perfect recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more\\nperfectly by the eventual inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of\\nsomeone from _outside_ the US disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness\\nas Americans. Ideally, they would be comments that disagreed with our\\ncollective American perception of being disagreeable. They would, of course,\\npoint out things about which citizens of other countries can disagree with\\nAmericans on. By exercising the right to disagree, we'd subtly agree that we\\nhave that right. Yet another level of recursion and a final layer of metaphor.\\n\\nThe response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming.\\nIn the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of\\nthe two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting\\nopinion published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express\\nhonestly held opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the\\ncircle on the metaphor in a perfect way.\\n\\nThings have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not\\nsure whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's\\njust been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader\\nwho will remain mercifully nameless:\\n\\n> We get enough America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and\\n> schools here in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite\\n> adjective here) from Belgium whining too!\\n\\nFollowed by:\\n\\n> ... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation of\\n> Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who\\n> would be able to replace him.\\n\\n... and, in a later note on the topic ...\\n\\n> Censorship is to be encouraged in a free-market society whenever and\\n> wherever it doesn't come from the government.\\n\\nClearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.\\n\\nChris has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the\\neditorial piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is\\nno exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill\\ncomments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has\\nshown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans\\nwith opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes\\nthe Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.\\n\\nSo, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue\\nto occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.\\n\\nJust watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye\\nout.\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

You've probably heard of\\nboth by now, as they've garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of\\nthe Linux world. You'll recall that I promised to try to secure copies for\\nreview this week. With the help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was\\nable to accomplish that task this morning. True to the second half of the\\npromise, we'll spend the next few days looking at these two products and how\\nthey might impact your Linux use. Let's take them in chronological order,\\nstarting today with CrossOver Plugin.\\n\\nA bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, \" ... the\\nleading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past\\nseveral years, an ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's\\na tough goal, but it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past\\nyear or so. Though the progress has been slow, the Wine project has managed to\\nstay at the front of this development realm.\\n\\nCrossOver Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior\\nto its release, Wine had taken a \"full system\" approach. Running Windows\\napplications in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no\\nsmall amount of configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from\\nthe system-wide approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than\\nexecuting at system startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual\\nWindows path to the called program. When the program is closed, so is Wine.\\nCrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with _one_\\nrelated set of Windows applications: browser plugins.\\n\\nThe results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a\\nsuccess. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media\\nPlayer 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible\\nbrowser plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian,\\nAuthorware Web Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every\\nneed plugin need covered.\\n\\nBut this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package\\nare viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several Microsoft-\\noriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications offered\\nby the CodeWeavers developers.\\n\\nHaving had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install\\nprocess and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with\\nmy RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped\\nfor the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did\\nwant these apps to work.\\n\\nThe installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script\\nfrom the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver\\nPlugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the\\nplugin installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the\\nbackground, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\\ drive on my\\nmachine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar\\nsight \\- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first\\nchecked for feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window,\\nthen stepped out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the\\ninstall failed four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a\\nfailure of the CrossOver program. I kept \"retry\"ing and, with some\\npersistence, managed to get a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the\\nApple servers. Quite literally, the install looked and performed exactly as\\nI've seem many times in Windows. When the install was completed, CrossOver\\nagain checked for the Windows binary, located the appropriate .dll files in\\nthe virtual C:\\ drive and dropped the plugins into the\\n/home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins directories.\\n\\nThe process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these\\nbrowsers - \"Help\", \"About Plugins.\" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime\\nplugin was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the \"Men In\\nBlack II\" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.\\n\\nI followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax\\nMessenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the\\nCrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me\\nto the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done.\\nWithin a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.\\n\\nThen, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite\\nthe recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went\\nas smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a\\nmuch faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact,\\nreminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty\\nstrong given my previous troubles with Wine.\\n\\nI also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda.\\nIn every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.\\n\\nWine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the\\ntedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With\\nthe backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to\\ndevelopment, Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows\\napplications seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so\\nstrong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins\\nactually run better in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't\\nrealize how much I missed them until I started using them in Linux today.\\n\\nTomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office\\npackage.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part IX**\\n\\nWe're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to\\ngo. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration\\nscreens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and\\nfunction of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear\\ndecision as to how to configure each section.\\n\\nToday, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you\\nneed parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either\\nas a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.\\n\\nMost will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows\\nprinter. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example,\\nthe builds I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as\\nthe telescope cameras were attached to this port.\\n\\nBe aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for\\nthe parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP,\\nor Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and\\nwill work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your\\nprinter following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in\\nthe BIOS.\\n\\nTomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Netics 2.0**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.citi.umich.edu[/URL]\\n\\n\"Netics is an extensible network statistics collector.

Pick of the Week    DECK    Version: 3.5    File size: 6.6MB    License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy    Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X    Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation    under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most    attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty    editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,    film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big    brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process    soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record    ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and    up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music    production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind    to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on    Deck:    [URL]http://clickthru.online.com[/URL]     Want to review Deck?

The Week in Wares    IN INTERNET:    CAPTAIN FTP    Version: 1.3    File size: 793K    License: Free    Minimum requirements: Mac OS X    Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain    FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and    downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes    full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,    you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like    without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The    program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming    interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address    book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves    awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:    [URL]http://clickthru.online.com[/URL]     Want to review Captain FTP?

AquilaCalendar is    refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar    windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,    week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize    your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists    and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a    handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The    interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting    organized no more difficult than it has to be.

Also, you'll be    able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client    such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit.

Even if you    don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a    spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while    setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll    also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear    of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through    eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10    subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came    from.

This is because any granting of \\nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \\ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \\noriginal author has the right to change his \\nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\\n\\n\\n{\\n\\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \\nholder automatically retains the right to change \\nthe licence.\\n\\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \\nall *copyright holders*\\n\\nThat's not my understanding. French law allows a \\nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \\nspecific conditions of the granting of such\\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\\nnothing to stop the original author taking\\nback \"his work\". The lawyers see this\\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n4) Hidden defects.\\n\\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \\nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \\nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \\nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\\n\\n\\n{\\n\\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \\nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \\nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \\naffects the GPL also.\\n\\nNiall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not\\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\\nand that's why it doesn't come under this point.\\n\\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\\narticle has been to see software \"sales\" (even\\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\\n\\n\\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\\nare not default. \\n\\nSee the bit about even the granting of \\nrights by an author having to be \\nexplicitly specified - under French law.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \\nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n5) Roughly.\\n\\nThere may be other reasons under French \\nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\\n\\n\\n\\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\\n\\n\\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \\nimperfect licences.\\n\\n\\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\\n\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \\nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \\nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \\nexamine the \"free\" licences and in particular the \\nGPL. They have published their study\\nin the review \"Proprietes intellectuelles \\n(Intellectual property)[1]\" and their\\nconclusion is grim.\\n\\n\\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \\nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \\nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \\nand the content of the text of free licences, and \\nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \\nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \\nfree programmes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbsence of critical clauses.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \\nreference to \"copyright\" is not legally \\nsufficient in the framework of international \\ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \\ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \\nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \\nbasically include differences from one country \\nto another. This is why, under international \\ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \\nlaws one is referring (French law, American &c.).\\n\\nThe authors only found three public licences \\nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \\nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\\nLicence).\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecification in the English language.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \\nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \\nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \\nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \\nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \\nEnglish and the FSF doesn't officially approve \\ntranslations. \\n\\nThe \"Toubon law\" obliges this sort \\nof contract to be written in French, including for \\nbusinesses since the notion of \"user\" applies not \\nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \\nprofessionals &c. \\n\\n\\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \\nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \\nfar as business is concerned, the \"Toubon \\nlaw\" is probably doomed to change since \\nit is in contradiction of European directives \\non the subject, but whatever about that, the \\nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \\nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \\nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \\nit is the law of the land.\\n\\n\\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \\nchange licence.\\n\\n\\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \\nthat according to French law, the author of \\na free programme can, at any time, invoke \\nthe invalidity of the licence for this \\nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\\n\\n\\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \\nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \\nrights by the author is subordinate to \\nthe condition that each of these granted \\nrights be the object of a distinct clause \\nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \\nthat the granting of any such rights be \\ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \\ngrantees, and also with respect to its \\nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \\nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \\n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \\nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \\nis French, that which is under the GPL could \\nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \\n \\n\\n\\nThe problem of the guarantee \"hidden defects\".\\n\\n\\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \\nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \\nthat the software is delivered \"without \\nguarantee\". You are going to immediately\\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \\nsame clause in their licence contracts,\\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \\nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\\nfree oneself from the \"guarantee from \\nhidden defects\", since it is imposed in the \\nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \\nby the layman, it protects the buyer\\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \\nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \\nconsumer protection law) against hidden \\ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \\nthe seller. \\n\\n\\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \\nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \\nspecifying that \"Sale items are neither \\nrefunded nor exchanged\", and on arriving \\nhome you notice that one of the socks has \\na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\\n\\n\\nYou could have checked the socks before \\npurchase: the flaw is deemed \"obvious\" and\\nyou can sing for your money.\\n\\n\\nYou couldn't check the socks (they were \\npackaged for example), and in this case, \\ndespite the notice \"neither refund nor \\nexchange\", you may invoke \"hidden defect\" \\nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \\nit's up to you. \\n\\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \\nthe \"hidden defect\" clause and it always \\nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \\ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \\nof the Civil Code). \\n\\n\\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \\nwide, it is necessary that you hadn't \\nthe possibility of discovering the defect \\nbefore buying the product and then \\n(according to the Civil Code) that you \\nwouldn't have bought it at that price if \\nyou had known about the\\ndefect.\\n\\n\\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \\nif you are able to show that the vendor had\\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't \\ninform you. In this case, not only does he \\nhave to reimburse the product, but all \\nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \\ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \\nwhich blew when you plugged it in &c.)\\n\\n\\nThis idea of \"hidden defect\" applies to\\n all products, including programmes. This \\nwas made abundantly clear by the \\nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \\nY2K. \\n\\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \\nfree programmes, since a site which \\noffers a Linux distro for download is \\nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \\nhidden flaws.\\n\\n\\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \\nin the case of a free programme, \\none could speak about a \"hidden\" defect \\nsince the source code was available, \\nhe replied \"Actually, concerning the \\nguarantee, the question of obvious \\ndefect will arise. This analyis will \\nbe different depending on whether the \\nperson who downloads the distribution \\nis an IT professional or not\". \\n\\nOpenSource has this advantage over \\nthe proprietary programme: it protects \\nthe distributor against a guarantee of\\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \\nIT person. But, for distribution to the \\npublic at large, the problem remains \\nthe same.\\n\\n\\n\\nRoughly Speaking.\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \\nthis study is far from being exhaustive \\nand many other areas could be explored. \\n\\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \\nfor example, about the fragility of the \\nGPL clause which forbids linking source \\ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \\n\\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \\nproperty give the right to the user \\nto modify a programme with the\\nintention of permitting interoperability \\nwith another programme. If for that,\\nI need to link with a proprietary library \\n(communication protocol, device driver)\\nI may consider as \"null and void\" this \\nclause of the GPL.\\n\\n\\nThe conclusion of this study is a wake \\nup call for the community. \"Freedom\" \\nmerits more than these shoddy licences, \\nwhich should be modified before court \\ncases over them proliferate and put at \\nrisk the undeniable originality of \\nthis effort.\\n\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\n\\n[1] Une publication de l'Institut \\nde recherche en proprit \\nintellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002\\n\\n[2] Une telle clause de contrat \\nqui est oppose  ce que dit la Loi \\nfranaise est qualifie en terme \\njuridique de  clause rpute \\nnon-crite , c'est--dire \\nqu'on fait comme si cette clause \\nn'tait pas crite dans le contrat. \\n\\nC'est pour cela par exemple que vous \\npouvez signer un bail pour un \\nappartement qui stipule que \\nles enfants sont interdits dans \\nl'immeuble, et envisager sans \\ninquitude d'avoir quand mme \\nun enfant, en effet le code civil \\nstipule que le devoir d'un locataire \\nd'un appartement doit se comporter \\nen  bon pre de famille  \\n\\n[3] Article L131-3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en franais !\\nYahoo!

Oh, neat. I have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if I had the time to try. I've been using another 6.x repository though. [URL]http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org[/URL] Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself, though. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \\nand the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \\nJust look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \\nclass had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \\nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \\nthere was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text \\nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \\ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \\nhistory. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \\nreciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \\nfor easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \\nof freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \\nbecome possible to see the federal government's main function as \\nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \\ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \\ninterests.\\n\\nEven now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \\nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find \\nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \\nmuch over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \\nestate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \\nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \\ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's \\nan insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because \\nthe public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon\\ncan't get themselves interested.\\n\\nOne corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \\nCommunications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \\ndenizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \\ncommerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \\nthe commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \\nprice: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \\ngrumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \\nthe high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \\ncomedy routine by the commission's chairman.\\n\\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \\nAmericans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \\na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \\nAmerican economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone \\nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \\nF.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \\nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \\n\"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \\nregulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \\namong others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \\npart of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \\nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \\nembodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \\npast two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \\nof dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \\ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\\n\\nThis year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \\nof the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \\nF.C.C. World's feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \\nand suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \\nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \\njust quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \\nenter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \\nresidential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \\nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It's a lot easier to \\nthink about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\\n\\n\\nEven in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \\ncommission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \\nintense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \\nitself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \\nPowell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \\nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \\nUnlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \\ngenerates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \\nwho he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the \\nhead of a federal agencyhe is thirty-nineand genially charming. \\nEverybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \\none of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \\nF.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \\narcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an \\n\"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \\npredecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \\nto Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \\ncalls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \\na right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \\ncautious. \"It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,\" \\nanother former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \\nanswer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \\nsubcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \\nsubcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \\nhim. \"You don't care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don't \\ncare about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the \\nfundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over \\nthere. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \\nseem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive \\nvice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \\nregulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \\njob?\"\\n\\n\"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\\n\\n\\nOne cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats \\nand liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \\nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \\ncreated by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \\nNew Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \\ncases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \\nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \\nother original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \\nthe national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \\nunfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \\nwell-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \\nsupervisionits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \\namong communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by \\nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \\nIn addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission \\nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \\nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \\nterrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank \\npresident and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \\nAccording to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \\nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \\nin the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \\nanti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \\nstation in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \\nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \\nniches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \\nbreakup of A.T. & T.by far the biggest and most important company the \\ncommission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of \\nself-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \\nago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \\nlong-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \\nwhich customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same \\ncompany. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \\nmid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \\nphone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \\nto offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \\neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand \\nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \\ntelephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \\nmonopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \\ncontrol over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \\nthe F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \\nand the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \\nconsumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \\nprosperous, too.\\n\\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \\none of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \\nmost people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \\nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \\nmodernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \\nbargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \\nas \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \\nof RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \\noffer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \\ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \\ncustomers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \\nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \\ncompetition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \\neconomics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \\nVice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \\nhelping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that \\nbrought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \\njobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \\nbeneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \\nslogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \\nthe twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \\nsent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \\ncorrelates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \\nsupposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\\n\\nThe F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \\naggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \\nall important interest groups they work with both parties); they \\nimmediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \\ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \\nrule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \\nReed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \\nthe arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \\nlike A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \\ncompanies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \\nlocal exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \\nequivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \\naccess to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \\nseeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \\nF.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\\n\\nPartly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \\nhe would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \\ncondition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \\nsee-leckscompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentand \\ninto other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \\ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \\nboom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \\nand other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \\nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \\nformer lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \\nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\\n\\n\\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \\nboom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \\nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \\nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \\nComcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \\nbelieved that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \\naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \\nundiscriminating.)\\n\\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \\ndetermined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \\nchairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \\ninfluence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \\nThree Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \\nHarold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \\nPatrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \\nsuch, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \\npowerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \\nS.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \\nthat the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \\nmight be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \\nRegulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \\nwasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \\nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \\nFurchtgott-Roth.\\n\\nPowell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \\nbefore a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \\ngave a very Michael Powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and \\nfree-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)that \\nbegan by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \\ntelecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \\noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \\nWhos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \\nbeast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \\nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's \\nfertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \\nleast, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \\nchairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \\npart of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \\nof the Bush Administration.\\n\\nTwenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \\nor dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \\nserious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \\ncompanies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \\nconcentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \\ncompanies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \\ngood shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \\ncompanies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \\nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \\nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \\nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \\nif they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \\nduopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \\nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \\npoor health of the long-distance companies.\\n\\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \\ncompanies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \\ndon't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \\nfully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part \\nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \\nTelecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \\nsignificantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \\nradio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \\nper cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \\nprogramming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \\nof Viacom.\\n\\nIn this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \\nbe hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the \\nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \\nto breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \\ndisallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \\nforces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle \\nto get new technologyespecially fast Internet connectionsinto the \\nhomes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An \\nanalogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \\nthe Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \\npeople, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \\npeople blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \\nexpectations and stirred too many passions.)\\n\\nBut Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \\nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \\nF.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \\nsignals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \\nthe F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has \\nbeen inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \\ninfuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \\nthe provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \\nF.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's \\nhaving the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \\nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \\ndivide\"that is, economic inequality in access to the Internethe said, \\n\"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and \\nI can't afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \\nAssociation convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \\ntumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \\nsomersault.\\n\\n\\nNot long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \\n1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \\nWashington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \\nthe western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \\nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \\nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \\nEven the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \\nfluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \\nwalks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \\njeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \\nof the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \\nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \\nthe idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \\nthe market before the fact\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to sayshould \\nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \\nlitigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \\nthen became a protg of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \\nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's \\nlegal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \\nthe New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political \\nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \\nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \\nalso maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of \\nArizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \\nenduring love of law school\"It's sort of like a law-school study \\nsession over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \\nconfirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \\nstudents, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.\\n\\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \\nof the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \\nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\\n\\n\"I think we'll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it's an \\nautomatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \\nthe best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and \\nsay, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor \\nputs a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law \\nabout what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \\na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a \\nsimilar proposition. There are scholars who argueindeed, the famous \\nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisthat \\nspectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \\nof ways that we're accustomed to.\"\\n\\nTalking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \\ndoesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \\nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \\nironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who \\nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \\nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \\nsees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \\nthought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \\nAct had been excessive.\\n\\n\"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can't fault those \\njudgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \\nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \\nBut, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, \\nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close \\nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \\non down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I \\ndon't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \\nor what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \\nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \\nreading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \\nBut, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \\nexcitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \\ncertainly was.\\n\\n\"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \\nexpectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \\neconomy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \\nexaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by \\npoliticians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \\ngold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \\nthat government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \\nsee numbers go up on the board.\"\\n\\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \\n'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \\nthirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \\nBells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' \" Now Powell returned \\nto being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \\nunrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're \\nthere. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \\nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no \\nquestion, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \\ndebt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business \\nmodel.\"\\n\\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \\nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \\nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \\nPowell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \\nopportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're \\nin it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \\ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \\nways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\\n\\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \\nhad been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn't have \\nevery home in America with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. I \\ndon't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy \\nthat. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The \\npart of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so \\nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\\n\\nOther local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable \\nbusinesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody's always saying, \\n'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's \\nquite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \\nyears to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once \\nevery thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're \\nlooking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance \\nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \\nbreaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\\n\\nCould the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \\nstronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political \\nanswer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \\nto help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \\nI can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \\ninvestigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have \\nthose kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, \\ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \\ndying.\" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think \\nit's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \\ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \\ngesturesin August, for example, five months after disbanding the \\nF.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \\nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \\ncommunications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \\nout the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \\nup the telecom industry.\\n\\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \\ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \\nservice. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there's one of each of \\nthose things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one \\nof each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \\ncapabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other.\" \\nAnyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \\nprovide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \\nprovide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \\n\"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \\nis, Does it stay that way?\"\\n\\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \\ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \\npeople confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \\nwhich distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it's easy. If you \\nwere to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we \\nknow how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \\nmarket's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \\nother dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \\nthe question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption \\nthere is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \\nviewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I \\nthink that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility \\nthat's ascribed to it sometimes.\"\\n\\nPowell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \\nparochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \\nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \\nexists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \\nthe planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \\nand then we have policies like\"here his tone went from ironic to \\nsarcastic\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \\nof what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \\nand opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \\nfairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \\ncan't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \\nhe regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \\nmarket, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying \\nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \\nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \\nAttorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything \\nat the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's \\nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \\nso that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the \\ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \\nnetworks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \\nTelecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never \\ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \\nand an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \\nsays, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \\nirreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\\n\\n\"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what \\nhas become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.much \\nmore than, say, the war in Afghanistanis a case in which a Gore \\nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \\nAdministration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \\nthere's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \\narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \\nhave done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that \\nhelped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \\narbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe \\nlong-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their \\nfriends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not \\nunrecognizably different from America's past.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism. Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries. Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed \"progressive transnationalism\". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a \"global\" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations. The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover, the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development. European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear - the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere in the world. On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of the US literally fantastic. At least, for now. Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European intellectual and political elite. The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America, however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it does on compliance with international \"norms.\" They view all departures from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic, authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results. Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume, therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights. None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase. That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism. --  ----------------- R. A.

The fake site was used to squeeze\\n more money out of people they had already hooked. \\n \\n The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,\\n (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being\\n taken in by the fake website. \\n \\n The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a\\n share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African\\n nations. \\n \\n NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would\\n otherwise spot the scam. \\n \\n Convincing site \\n \\n News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an\\n unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out\\n their victims. \\n\\n A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had \"the\" in\\n front of the bank's name. \\n \\n \"I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,\" said the NCIS\\n spokesman. \"It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced\\n online.\" \\n \\n Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people\\n behind it have not been caught. \\n \\n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \\n \\n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \\n\\n Domain games \\n \\n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \\n \\n The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\\n crimes. \\n \\n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \\n \\n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\\n it. \\n \\n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \\n \\n Cutting edge fraud \\n \\n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\\n legitimacy. \\n \\n \\n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\\n \\n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\\n place of the certificates. \\n \\n \"To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\\n technology,\" said the spokesman. \\n \\n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\\n Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. \\n \\n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\\n been deposited in their name. \\n \\n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \\n \\n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \\n \\n Modern gloss \\n \\n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\\n old cons a modern gloss. \\n \\n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \\n \\n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\\n true, undoubtedly is. \\n \\n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\\n service Paypal. \\n \\n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \\n \\n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It's more of a chipset/drive problem than a Drive by itself.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in \"AllowDuplicated\",  meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same  time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one  version available. 'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it... --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Programs such as mozilla and various others use these\\nfunctions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary\\ncode or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.\\n\\nThese new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory\\nleaks in reading image functions.\\n\\nSince most applications which display images use libpng, this affects\\nmany applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red\\nCarpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.\\n\\nXimian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris\\npackages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,\\nthey will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade\\nlibpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2.

[URL]http://wwws.sun.com[/URL] integrated into solaris.\\n\\nYeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum\\ncleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would\\nreally like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.\\n\\n> Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the\\n> interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can\\n> specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home,\\nand\\n> come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?\\n\\nEr, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro\\nspecific, anyway.\\n\\nI am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script\\nchanges. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.\\n\\nI do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are\\npicked up by silo. So:\\n  boot disk linux\\n\\nwould not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there\\nit is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be\\nautomatic from there on.\\n\\n> I don't see why this should be a _major problem.

Once the machine is\\ninstalled\\n> cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after\\nall\\n> (sorry couldn't resist!)\\n\\nThe problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty\\ndrivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in\\nprompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM\\non shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or\\nkeyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power\\nswitch hidden at the back of the case.\\n\\nI think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is\\n/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down\\nproperly.\\n\\n- Matthew\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\\n[URL]http://uk.my.yahoo.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
