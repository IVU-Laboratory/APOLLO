Dear Sir/Madam, Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and if it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this channel.  I am AUDITOR EDWARD CHIEF AUDITOR MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC.I got your information when I was searching for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and lists in the web site.I wish to transfer the sum of $14,300,000.00 USD (FourteenMillion Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account.  This fund was a residue of the over invoiced Industrial Contract bills awarded by MINISTRIE OFFINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC to some foreign firms.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the chief auditor,I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary. It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region.  The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance andpartnership in your country.  I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum ascompensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings.  NAME OF YOUR BANK....................................ADDRESS OF THE BANK..................................ACCOUNT NUMBER.......................................BENEFICIARY\u0092S NAME...................................TEL/FAX NUMBERS OF THE BANK..........................COUNTRY OF BANK......................................YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER.............................YOUR AGE.............................................OCCUPATION........................................... Upon the receipt of this informations,the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay.As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefullyand lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved.  Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:- 1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00. 2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00. 3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.

I am Barrister Kenneth Obi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folded as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from June 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insurance Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Life policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.\\nIn 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not terminate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  for cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a letter from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for further discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Three Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chairman of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they asked me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.\\nSince 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I went back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and senile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to get any of  the Chairman\u2019s relative with his authorization to claim the surrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bearing same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surrender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money would be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I feel it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use some percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.\\nI contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the money if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect and regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to whoever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my file some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim application specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the Insurance Company for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot execute this transaction for any reason, please introduce someone who is capable and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction.

I came to know of you in my \\nsearch for a reliable person to handle a very \\nconfidential transaction that involves the transfer of \\na huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound \\nstrange but exercise patience and read on. There were \\nseries of contracts executed by a consortium \\nMultinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry \\nof Petroleum Resources among which were: \\n\\n1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria \\nfor crude oil, Down stream products distribution and \\nsubsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. \\n\\n2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of \\nthe various refineries in the country~ US$ 152Million. \\n\\n\\n3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum \\nproducts (Depots) US$240 Million. The original values \\nof this contract were deliberately over invoiced to \\nthe sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has \\nnow been approved and is now ready to be transferred \\nbeing that the companies that actually executed these \\ncontracts has been fully paid and project officially \\ncommissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are \\nwilling to transfer the total amount to your account \\nfor subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant \\nand are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau \\n(Civil Servant Laws) from opening operating foreign \\naccount in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed \\non you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we \\nhave agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum \\nwhile 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses \\n(Internal & External) between the parties in the \\ncourse of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up \\nan investment plan for us of which you will control \\nsince we cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We \\nare very interested in investing in real estate in \\nyour country. You must however note that this \\ntransaction is subjected to the following termsand \\nconditions: \\n\\n1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty \\nanddiligence. \\n\\n2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost \\nsecrecy and confidentiality because of \\nthecircumstances we now find ourselves. \\n\\n3. That the funds would be transferred to an account \\nover which you have absolute control. Modalities have \\nbeen worked out at the highest level of the presidency \\nat the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate \\ntransfer of the funds within 14 working days, subject \\nto your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our \\nassurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To \\naccord this transaction, the legality it deserves and \\nfor mutual security of the parties involved and the \\nfunds, the whole approval procedures will be \\nofficially and legally processed with your name or the \\nname of your company you may nominate as the bonafide \\nbeneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of \\ncontacting you is for the obvious reason that we will \\nwant to invest these funds in the real estate.

PETER LANG \\nPostfach, 3001 Bern Switzerland \\n\\nIMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE.\\n\\n I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. PROPOSITION; We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7,500,000.00 (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$7,500,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following; 1. Your name and address 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with a million dollars on final conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please response immediately,\\nI await your urgent response. \\nRegards,\\nMr. Peter Lang \\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nCe Message a \ufffdt\ufffd compos\ufffd avec le module WebMail du site \"Le Trublion Picard\"\\n- [URL]http://www.letrublion.info[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

When I accepted the offer, they forwarded all your banking particulars to me for onward transfer. As soon as I made some fruitful efforts on the business and demanded my US$200,000.00 as agreed, your partners deviated from the agreement and decided to go through the International Remittance Department at my back and made a change of your bank account in other to disappoint me and not knowing that the International Remittance Department is also under my control.

Which ever the option you chooses,feel free to notify \\nme.\\n\\nI have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might \\nincure in the process of this transaction.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nFROM:MR.LI LE SONG\\nHang Seng Bank Ltd\\nFu Shan Mansion\\n25 Taikoo Shing Road\\nTaikoo Shing Branch\\nHong Kong.\\n\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n  I am Mr. Li Le Song credit officer of the Foriegn operations dept of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Taikoo Shing Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Colonel sadiq uday who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United state Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the colonel and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was alsO discovered that Colonel Sadiq Uday did not declare any next of kin in his,official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my \\n bank. So, Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it, What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 6 month the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against thisbackdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq Uday so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq Uday,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the\\nnecessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this Issue.Once the funds have been transrred to your nominated bank account the sharing ratio is open for negotiation for you. Should, you be interested please! send me your full names andcurrentresidential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address(lilesong56@3xl.net) and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\n Kind Regards\\n\\nMr.Li Le Song\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site colonialspacemarines.com\\n- [URL]http://colonialspacemarines.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.\\nAnd the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to\\nThe deceased. \\nWhen you receive this letter.

PLC,COTONOU-REPUBLIC\\nOF BENIN.Branch.This business request may seem strange, but I crave\\nyour indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced\\nthat you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money\\ntransfer.\\n\\nOn August, 2002, a retired Atlanta physician Mr George Brumley Jr\\nmade a numbered  time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at nine million pound sterlin(9.000,000) in my branch\\nupon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding\\naddress but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and\\nfinally we discovered from his contract employers, that the Atlanta\\nphysician Mr George Brumley Jr and his family died in the plane\\ncrash On july ,2003.See site below for confirmation of the death.\\nMay there Gentle soul rest in peace.\\n\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died alongside with\\nhis next of kin and attempts to trace his further next of kin were\\nfruitless.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting\\nhis extended next of kin (family members)to come over and claim his\\nmoney because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it\\nas next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our\\nbanking guidlines and laws but unfortunately  we learnt that all his\\nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. This sum of\\n9.000,000 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal\\nsum at the end of each year . If no one ever come forward to claim it\\naccording to African law, at the expiration of (four)years,the money\\nwill revert to the ownership of the Benin Government if nobody applies\\nto claim the fund.\\n\\nConsequently, my proposal to you is that I will like you to stand as\\nthe next of kin to Mr George Brumley Jr and claim this funds so that\\nthe fruit of the old man's labor will not get into the hands of some\\ncorrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to\\nprovide immediately your full name and address so that i can apply for\\nan Attorney on your behalf who will prepare the necessary documents and\\naffidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall\\nemploy the service of a probate attorney for the drafting and\\nnotarization of the Will and obtain the necessary documents and letter\\nof probate administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank\\naccount in any part of the world which you will provide will then\\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of\\nkin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio\\nof  40% for me and 40% for you and 10% will be set aside for expenses\\nincured during the process while the other 10% will be given to charity\\norganisation.There is no risk at all;the paperwork for this transaction\\nwill be done by the attorney and my position as the banks branch Bills\\nand Exchange Manager guarantees the successful execution of this\\ntransaction.\\n\\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email\\naddress below .Upon your response,I shall provide you with more details\\nand relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\nPlease upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following\\nto enable me start the processing of the fund transfer:\\n  1.)

The Government had already concluded plans to freeze all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal and have on the 18th of October 2004 decided to sell off the assets of all Yukos Oil corporation at a give-away amount to pay the allege taxes which the company owed the Russian Government.refer to the website again. Everybody in the world know that this is a political vendetta to ensure that Mikhail Khodorkovsky comes out of detention as poor and broken man and his companiesare liquidated, that if he is not eventually sent to jail for tax evasion. The Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this transaction) and I have decided to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the above amount which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations. Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because they agitated for their payments when they heared that my boss was arrested and might eventually be jailed by the RussianGovernment. YOUR ROLE: I will present you/your company as one of the contractors we are owing so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your company. I will arrange for the documentation which the payee bank will need to transfer the sum to you. The transaction has to be concluded before as soon as possible. You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this? If this proposal is acceptable to you, Please send me your direct and private, telephone and fax number and email address to enable me furnish you with more information as we intend to conclude the transfer within 14 working days.

Please bear with me let me introduce myself. I am\\nBarrister Tony Abbas, the attorney to Late Engr Alex, a National of your\\ncountry, who owned a metal producing factory (Metalco Enterprise) in Nigeria\\nand a personal friend died and left behind his deposit in a finance house\\n(GLOBAL SECURITIES & FINANCE COMPANY) valued at $14.5Millon (Fourteen Million\\nFive Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only).\\n\\n    My relationship with Engr.Alex started in 1999 when I was working\\nwith the security company as a Legal Adviser, Marina branch. We met in my social\\nclub's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said security\\ncompany where he deposit most of his treasures some few weeks later,making me\\nthe Legal officer to the account which he operated until his unfortunate\\ndemise.On the 31st of March 2001, Engr.Alex, his wife and their two children\\nwere involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately\\nlost their lives.\\n    After the incident i contacted Engr.Alex sister (Ms Martha Stevens)\\nwhich was his beneficiary/next of kin but unfortunately before she\\ncould claim his estate she too died in September 11, 2001 terrorist\\nattack at the world trade center in the United State Of America. See\\n[URL]http://edition.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n    Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of Engr.Alex\\nextended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these\\nseveral unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over\\nthe Internet, to locate any member of his family or anyone related to him hence\\nI contacted you .
