I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. \\nThe latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:[URL]http://www.newswatchngr.com[/URL]] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; [URL]http://www.thisdayonline.com[/URL], click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.\\nOn this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.\\nAnd thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. \\nMy problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.\\nI shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.\\nIn acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.\\nThanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation.

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some\\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future\\nmay be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to\\nremain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. \"Every major\\nindustry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar\\ntransformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the\\nmid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert\\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.\\nChristopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all the people\\nthat are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving\\ncarriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few\\nmillions.\" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the\\nlink at the end of this newsletter._\\n\\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)\\nhas only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As\\nInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this\\ncompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.\\nThis could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our\\nHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**\\n\\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.\\nA similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),\\nshare price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over\\n$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously\\nhad a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267\\nmillion.\\n\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for\\npotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a\\nfew months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an\\nincrease of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and\\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to\\noffer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building\\na communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will\\nexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market\\nwill return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,\\nIndia, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_\\n\\n\\n\\n**Particulars**\\n\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth\\nrecommendation list for the following reasons:\\n\\n1\\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and\\nmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to\\nsmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1996, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.\\n          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.\\n            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.\\n          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.\\n\\nPersonal Regards,\\nMr. Jun Cheng\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent to Webmaster.\\n- [URL]http://www.1stpd.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately \\nyour full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary \\ndocuments and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.\\n\\nWe shall employ the serivce of theAttorney for drafting and notarization of \\nthe (WILL) and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of \\nprobate/administration in your favour for the release of the deposited fund. \\nA Bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide then to \\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. \\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% \\nfor me and 40% for you.\\n\\nThere is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will be done \\nby the Attorney and my position as the Director opreation guarantee the \\nsuccessful execution of this transaction.

I know I did - many times! However,\\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\\n\\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\\n\\nI'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\\nto one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\\ndoing had I not.

Due to the popularity of this letter on\\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\\nnot the program was legal.\\n\\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\\nthe program and if people can 'follow the simple\\ninstructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks\\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\\nBETTER THAN EVER.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n==================================================\\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple\\nsteps and NOT change anything.\"\\n\\nMore testimonials later but first, =======\\n\\n==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every\\n4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the\\nfollowing...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!\\n\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND \\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\n\\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====\\n\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE\\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP\\nLEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\\n\\n===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===\\n===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save\\nthem on your computer and resell them.\\nYOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.\\n\\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.\\nSave them on your computer so they will be accessible\\nfor you to send to the 1,000's of people who will\\norder them from you.

This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let's\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That's 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\\n==================================================\\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider's Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\"\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\n\\nRobert Borowczyk\\nul.

If you do not, continue advertising or\\nsending e-mails until you do.\\n\\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\\nin front of a different report.\\n\\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\\n=================================================\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \\nYou have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\\nafter you have put your name and address in\\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\\nname will be on every one of them. \\n\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\\n\\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn't a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in.
