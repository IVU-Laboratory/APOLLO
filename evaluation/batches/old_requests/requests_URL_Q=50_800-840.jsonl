My guess is \\n    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. \\n    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a \\n    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the \\n    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to \\n    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an \\n    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic \\n    shakeout in Webcasting is \"inevitable and desirable because it will bring \\n    about market consolidation.\" That's really it in a nutshell. \"Market \\n    consolidation\" means the less artists they have to promote, the less \\n    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the \\n    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because \\n    that's all you'll be able to find out there.  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://slashdot.org[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \\nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \\nother things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \\n10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \\nconvinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it \\nall without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll \\nbe back this afternoon. \\n\\nMy email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \\nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \\n\\nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \\nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \\nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \\nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \\nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \\nvocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so \\ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \\n\\nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \\nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \\ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \\ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \\nquestions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in \\nmy RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file \\nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \\nfeed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \\nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \\ndictionary.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.peerfear.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. \\n- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the \\nbrightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to \\nyesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? \\nToday's newzzz... Never mind. \\n- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a \\nFOAF file from an RSS feed. \\n- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward \\ncompatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. \\n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \\nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \\n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \\naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \\nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. \\n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is \\nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \\nusers.&#8221; \\n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \\nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \\n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to \\nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \\ngive it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... \\nand plunks it into the oil.&#8221; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  [URL]http://philringnalda.com[/URL]\\n[2]  [URL]http://philringnalda.com[/URL]\\n[3]  [URL]http://www.decafbad.com[/URL]\\n[4]  [URL]http://howto.looselycoupled.com[/URL]\\n[5]  [URL]http://howto.looselycoupled.com[/URL]\\n[6]  [URL]http://weblog.delacour.net[/URL]\\n[7]  [URL]http://rss.benhammersley.com[/URL]\\n[8]  [URL]http://www-106.ibm.com[/URL]\\n[9]  [URL]http://web.resource.org[/URL]\\n[10] [URL]http://weblog.burningbird.net[/URL]\\n[11] [URL]http://groups.yahoo.com[/URL]\\n[12] [URL]http://burningbird.net[/URL]\\n[13] [URL]http://ln.hixie.ch[/URL]\\n[14] [URL]http://maccentral.macworld.com[/URL]\\n[15] [URL]http://www.usablenet.com[/URL]\\n[16] [URL]http://www.globeandmail.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I want the land to be forever fertile in America.\" With a blink\\nof the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made\\nfertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, \"I want a wall\\naround France, so that no one can come into our precious country.\"  Again,\\nwith a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around\\nFrance.  The Englishman asks, \"I'm very curious. Please tell me more about\\nthis wall.  The Genie explains, \"Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet\\nthick and nothing can get in or out.\"  The Englishman says, \"Fill it up\\nwith water.\"\\n\\nFenchie>Plutt nous devrions nous noyer que mangent la cuisine anglaise.\\n\\nShlpey> Them French, you dont know what they are on about but damn it sure\\nsounds romantic.

He traveled first to\\nWales, where he asks a farmer to explain his method: \"Well, boyo, I put\\nher back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves,\\nand we're well away. Tidy!\"  The professor tries Scotland next \"Hoots an'\\ntoots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with\\nme velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!\"  The professor\\nmoves on to Germany: \"Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her\\nwith my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a\\npattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his\\ninvestigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and\\nasks him to explain the French method: \"Well monsieur, I put her back legs\\ndown my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and\\nthat's all there is to it!\" The professor is excited to have found some\\nnational variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods\\nof the Scots, Welsh and Germans. \"How do they do it then?\" asks Pierre,\\nand the professor explains.
