He \\nassured me of your capability and releability to champion this\\nbusiness opportunity.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a \\nplane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless\\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here \\nstipulates that if such money\\nremained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the \\nbank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in \\nthis business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in \\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location\\nwherein the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \\nmore explanations.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR YUSUF SAMI.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Good day, \\n\\nThis email message requires your utmost confidentiality. \\n\\nIt is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. \\n\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. \\n\\nMy Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her!\\n e \\n(Holland) to seek for political asylum. \\n\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. \\n\\nSince President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. \\n\\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. \\n\\nYour role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. \\n\\nAfter the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \\n\\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. \\n\\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. \\n\\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \\n\\nPlease contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part. \\n\\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, visit the links below and read. \\n\\n[URL]http://www.the-idler.com[/URL]  \\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]  \\n\\nSincerely, \\nO.C.Savimbi. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

I am writing, following the impressive\\ninformation about you through one of my friends WORKS WITH THE BURKINA \\nCHAMBERS firm.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $U.S15.5Million dollars\\n(fifteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars)  in an account that \\nbelongs\\n\\nto one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in\\nNovember 2004  in a plane crash.\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless\\n\\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\\nindicated in our banking  guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt\\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at\\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon\\nthis discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to\\nmake this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next\\n\\nof kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\nThe banking law and guidling here stipulates that  if such money remained\\nunclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occassioned by the fact  that the customer was a foreigner\\n\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in\\nrespect  to the  provision of a foriegn account, 10% will be set aside for\\nexpenses occured during the business and 60% would be for me and my\\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according  to the percentage indicated.\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation wherein the money will be remitted.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch  -free and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you recieve this letter.\\nYours faithful\\nBill & Exchange Manager.\\nYOBO\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLes rvlations de la starac 6 commentes par Jrmy! \\n[URL]http://starac2006.spaces.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
