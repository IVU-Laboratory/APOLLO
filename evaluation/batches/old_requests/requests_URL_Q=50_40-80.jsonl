There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're looking for a few \"really good programmers\", says the CTO. I know him -- very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth. Joe Bob says \"check it out\". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can send it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I don't know you guys anyway...

I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for\\nthe past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I\\nfind it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads \"fatal\\nerror\" and offers to \"save\" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a\\nfew weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.\\nGone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters\\nbut everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?\\nWhen will this pain stop? \\n\\nI got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival\\nis screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the\\nUnited States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always\\nso proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where\\nmy memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last\\nwinter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the\\nroom, catching a scene here and there, saying, \"Boy, that's something,\\nisn't it!\" \\n\\nI don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two\\nmonths. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no\\nmatter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it\\nwill be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my\\nsadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the\\nother way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few\\nweeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had\\ndecided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so\\nempty and more alone. I had agreed to go on \"Crossfire\" and Donahue (thank\\nGod for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of\\nthose stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no\\none can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. \\n\\nThey agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about\\naren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist\\ncountry, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I\\nwould just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -\\nbut then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and\\nsmiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I\\nintend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any\\nother nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the\\nmajority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause\\nwe're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC\\nfor a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that\\nnumerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob\\nNovak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said\\nthat capitalism is a \"sin.\"\\n\\nMy dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive\\nwith him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he\\ntold me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going\\nto college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had\\na secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to\\nbe counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil\\nfilter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave\\nus all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. \\n\\n                      *        *       *       *       *        *\\n\\nDad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom\\nwould have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how\\nhappy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey\\nin my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the\\nscreening of \"Roger & Me\" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I\\ngot to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,\\nand how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how\\nI stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause\\nand more. \\n\\nIt's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF\\nselection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.\\n\"Politics,\" is what I have been told. Too \"populist\" for the new elite who\\nnow sit in judgment of what is art. \"They don't want to help further your\\nplatform Mike,\" a person close to the committee tells me. \"One of them even\\nsaid, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally\\nwant to contribute to its popularity.'\"  So, it was decided that \"Bowling\\nfor Columbine,\" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as\\n\"one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,\" a film chosen\\nby every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film\\nmust not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room\\nwhere we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this\\ntime, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -\\nright straight through the heart of an America that is both master and\\nvictim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will\\nalways remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos\\nwho, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a\\nonce great art form.\\n\\n                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\nMy dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside\\njust as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for\\ninspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I\\nmight have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right\\npeople, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the\\nnext round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,\\nand he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in\\nthe middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell\\nhim I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through\\nsecurity and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back\\nand see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.\\n\\nI'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag\\nwhen I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting\\nuntouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to\\nrush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight\\nbag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night\\nand day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,\\nholding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair\\non my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran\\nuncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had\\nan 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said\\nthe chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!\\nI've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can\\ndo! Don't let her die.\\n\\nThe priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad\\nasked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our\\ngoodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I\\nam sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the\\nscreen through the tears...maybe someday...)\\n\\nThe night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise\\nplanned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to\\nshow it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what\\nshe has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in\\nthat list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever\\nmattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,\\nthe way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being\\nthankful for.\\n\\nI never got to show her the movie that night. \"Mike!\" she called out from\\nthe porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. \"Get your father! I don't\\nfeel good.\" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be\\ngone.\\n\\n                 *          *          *          *          *          *\\n\\nI'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to\\nDenver, and I hear someone say, \"OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!\" I\\nturn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I\\napologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at\\nthe Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her\\neyes. \"My mom died in October,\" she says, and I realize that this pain that\\nfeels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No\\none is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me\\nabout how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how\\nis my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She\\ngives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At\\nthat moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this\\nyear-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in\\nthis, and so I ask her how she is doing. \"I think a lot,\" she says, \"about\\nall the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I\\nbelieve she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it\\nall.\"\\n\\nThey call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see\\nif he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got\\ntalking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother\\ngetting cancer and how she was caring for her. \"She said that her bill in\\nthe hospital came to $60,000,\" he says with astonishment. \"They won't be\\nable to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave\\nher a tip along with the toll.\"\\n\\n\"You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.\"\\n\\nThat is my father. That was my mother. \\n\\nYours, \\n\\nMichael Moore\\nmike@michaelmoore.com\\n[URL]http://www.michaelmoore.com[/URL]\\n\\nPS. Thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed\\nto the local poverty program in my mother's name. I was so moved by your\\ngenerosity and by your words of love and kindness.

It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image\\nof some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is\\nintrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is\\nnot graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary\\nif you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.\\nThere have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the\\nearly 1980s if not before.\\n\\nA generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement\\nsnapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information\\nmust (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you\\nwrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly\\nadequate.\\n\\nIt does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed\\nand what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)\\nmust not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,\\nor to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS\\nlives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not\\ntried it on extf3 or reiser.) \\n\\nBTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of\\nwriting to RAID4 or RAID5...\\nI would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense\\nto use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do\\nnot have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and\\nthere is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk\\nmay hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault\\nrecovery\\nand lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?\\n\\nGlenn Everhart\\n\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com]\\nSent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 3:04 PM\\nTo: Webappsec Securityfocus.Com; SECPROG Securityfocus\\nSubject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from\\nattacks\\n\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a\\nbase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base\\nimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes\\nchanges to its own \"redo\" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance\\nincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the\\ncurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.\\n\\nThis is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the\\nhoneypots mailing list)\\n[URL]http://www.vmware.com[/URL]\\n\\nCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server\\napplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,\\neven before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.\\n\\nThe physical architectures of most production client/server systems are\\nlayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server\\nrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net\\nbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one\\nof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database\\nserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one\\npartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the\\npartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from\\none boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap\\nspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.\\n\\nWhen someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that\\nshouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or\\nApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But\\nwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a \"delta\" or\\n\"redo\" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the\\nredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be\\nminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from\\nbackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high\\navailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is\\nalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at\\nthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater\\nperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be\\napplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions\\n(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)\\n\\nDoes anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept\\nbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?\\nI use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in\\nthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server\\nsystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and\\nnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly\\nghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or\\nno) downtime.\\n\\nThanks for any opinions,\\nBen\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\\n\\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's\\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\\nrisk to humans.\\n\\n\"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\\nexposure levels\" as well, the report said. \"The potential human health\\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\\nuncertainties are involved.\"\\n\\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\\n\\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\\n\\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\\n\\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\\n\\nThe EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\\ngauging pollution health concerns.\\n\\nBut in this case, the report said, \"the exposure-response data are\\nconsidered too uncertain\" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\\ncancer risk to an individual.\\n\\nNevertheless, said the report, the \"totality of evidence from human, animal\\nand other supporting studies\" suggests that diesel exhaust \"is likely to be\\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\\nenvironmental exposure.\"\\n\\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\\n\"chronic respiratory hazard to humans\" contributing to increased asthma and\\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\\n\\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\\nenvironmental organization, said: \"To reduce the public's exposure to\\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment.\"\\n\\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\\nForum, said the EPA's report \"focused on the past,\" whereas \"the future is\\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago.\"\\n\\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell ([URL]www.maxwell.com[/URL] makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag! On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut? ----- Original Message ----- From: \"R. A.

Not a bad idea at all, provided we avoid Texas's mistake.  If we get  two senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus  our fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting  block in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political  spectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the  current US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left  by the US political establishment later, we own the place. Byzantium, anyone? Andrew D.

Just under half the people\\n now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three\\n quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,\\n regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. \\n \\n That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per\\n cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared\\n with 60 per cent in 1987. \\n \\n Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on\\n what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published\\n today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on\\n interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. \\n \\n Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of\\n twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with\\n two thirds of pensioners. \\n \\n But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with\\n graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a\\n third less racist. \\n \\n That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from\\n and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a\\n powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. \\n \\n Mr Blairs famous mantra education, education, education seems far less\\n consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with\\n an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people\\n get degrees, degrees buy less and less, he said. \\n \\n But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the\\n undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, he added. \\n \\n He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just\\n political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would\\n give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. \\n \\n Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and\\n university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists\\n should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,\\n three times as many as those with no qualifications. \\n \\n It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report\\n says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased\\n contact with alternative points of view. \\n \\n Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their\\n idealism, but found the opposite to be true. \\n \\n Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong\\n with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He\\n said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older\\n generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. \\n \\n Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half\\n the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven\\n years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,\\n with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. \\n \\n A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,\\n and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the\\n chances. \\n \\n One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on\\n heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of\\n people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept\\n up to 97 per cent. \\n \\n The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal\\n free-for-all, Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. People are making\\n quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong. \\n \\n On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think\\n that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits  in\\n fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth\\n in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that\\n half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure\\n was 40 per cent. \\n \\n The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live\\n with their parents, twice as many as women.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\\n\\n \\n\\nYour use of Yahoo!

Then put this on\\na new line in \\n\\n/etc/modules\\n\\nin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do\\n\\nmodprobe nvdriver\\n\\nto load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the\\ndriver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the\\nnvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not\\nopen source).\\n\\n> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best \\n> solution? Can I rid myself of the tar file installations and find some \\n> specific .deb packages?\\n\\nThe nvidia driver source is in the Woody tree.\\n\\n[URL]http://packages.debian.org[/URL]\\n\\nso you can do\\n\\napt-get install nvidia-kernel-src\\n\\nand then compile, although I've always gone the route you're doing now.\\n\\nIdeally the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day 1.\\nHowever, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is\\npre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific\\nkernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did).  As\\ndebian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package\\nand have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if\\nthey're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.\\n\\nGavin\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"BGD\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two  approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently  `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called  an XIM (X Input Method).   WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on            my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,            and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese            script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! ***  XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you  build up your character as a series of composes of the root or  fundamental strokes (\"radicals\", I think they are called), and  then \"commit\" the composite character to the application.  ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe   a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!   and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )  some XIMs compose \"in place\", others do it on a special line,  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).  also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input  mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,  which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which  apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---  implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII  input mode (what us English-speakers would call \"normal\"  keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).  I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often  a toggle, and something like .  many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading. cheers! \t-blf- p.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8       locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called \"limbo\" release,       then you may quite possibility be using one by default. -- \u00abHow many surrealists does it take to    |  Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland  change a lightbulb?

Prepare LILO to boot the new disk    (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)    We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot    Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want    to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will    become the first hard disk.    Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:         disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second                                       # disk as if it were the first                                       # disk (BIOS ID 0x80).         boot=/dev/hdb                 # Install LILO on second hard                                       # disk.         map=/new-disk/boot/map        # Location of \"map file\".         install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's                                       # boot sector.         prompt                        # Have LILO show \"LILO boot:\"                                       # prompt.         timeout=50                    # Boot default system after 5                                       # seconds.

Wojciechowski Jr. posted about this issue on 7/26,\\nbut I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report\\nfrom a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.\\nThe way I solved it was to run \\n\\nrazor-admin -create\\n\\nand\\n\\nrazor-admin -discover\\n\\nwith a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is\\nexplicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.\\n\\nThe manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be\\nloaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a\\n.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist\\n(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may\\nlead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery\\nand other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The\\nworkaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to\\nrazorhome on the command line, e.g.\\n\\nrazor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create\\nrazor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover\\n\\nhth,\\nSteve\\n\\n-- \\nhesketh.com/inc. v: (919) 834-2552 f: (919) 834-2554 w: [URL]http://hesketh.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\\nfor high-tech professionals.
