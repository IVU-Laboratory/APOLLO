This \\nbusiness request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you, view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us \\nwith a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an \\naccountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the \\nApex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.\\n \\nI am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a\\n  very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;\\n (i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the \\nforeign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the \\nwhole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is \\nfirst to furnish us with the following through my email address.\\n1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )\\n2.) The beneficiary's name,\\n3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a \\nsmooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria \\nGovernment Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me \\nimmediately through my personal E-mail: uzor5@myway.com or call me on my \\nreceiving number:234-8042137980 for more details.\\nBest regards as we look forward to hearing from you soonest.\\nYour Sincerely,\\nDR UZOMA OBI.\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n----------------------------------------------\\n[URL]http://www.zahnklinik-innsbruck.at[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

After going through some old files in the records I \\ndiscovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the \\nmoney is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will \\nbeforfeited for nothing.\\n\\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Howard Sweeney, a foreigner, a miner and an \\nindustrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since \\n1993 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My \\ninvestigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and \\nthat Mr.Howard Sweeney until his death was the manager Sweeney Coy.(pty). \\nSA. We will start the first transfer with six million dollars \\n[$6,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your \\nside, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your \\naccount.\\n\\nThe amount involved is (USD 29M) Twenty Nine million United States Dollars \\nonly. I want to first transfer$6,000.000 [Six million United States Dollar] \\nfrom this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I \\ndon't know any foreigner.\\n\\nI am revealing this to you with believein God that you will never let me \\ndown in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax \\nnumber including the full details of the account to be used for the\\ndeposit.\\n\\nI need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this \\nbusiness proposition.\\nWith my influence and the position of a bank official whom is working in our \\nfavour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which \\nyou can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our \\nphysical arrival in your country for sharing.\\n\\nThe bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we \\nreceive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you \\ncan come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make \\nthis remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at \\nleast two days ahead of the money going into the account.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \\namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\\n\\nI look forward to your earliest response.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nMrs.Vikki Meade.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nSee their smiles, hear their laughter with Windows Live Messenger! \\n[URL]http://messenger.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to \\nget a good and capable business person in your country for both business and \\ninvestment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am  Barrister \\nFrank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson \\nan American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost \\nhis life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on \\nJanuary 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.\\n\\nYou can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,\\n\\n1. [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n2. [URL]http://www.nativefederation.org[/URL]\\n\\nBefore the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit \\nfor 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE \\nHUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity \\nseveral notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no \\nresponse came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his \\nfamily had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it \\nwas also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's  next of kin was his daughter \\nwho died with him in the crash.\\n\\nWhat bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the \\nexpiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. \\nGOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my \\nsuggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the \\nnext of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these \\nfunds for both of us.\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:-\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall \\ncome out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document \\nthat will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.\\n\\nPLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW,\\n\\n[1] NAME:\\n\\n[2] ADDRESS:\\n\\n[3] AGE:\\n\\n[4] SEX:\\n\\n[5] TELEPHONE:\\n\\n[6] FAX:\\n\\n[7] OCCUPATION STATUS:\\n\\nAlso be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to \\naccomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been \\nmade the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your \\nbehalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in \\nyour favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided \\nby you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities \\nto see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the \\nnecessary documents.\\n\\nPlease note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times \\nduring this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your \\nnominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for \\nyou and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this \\ntransaction. If you are not interested, please delete this letter so that I \\ncan scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction. Should \\nyou be interested please send me your full names, telephone, fax number and \\nemail address as stated above.

I wouldn't go much deep detailing the problem I am having in my own country Zimbabwe, but you can have a look on This web-site;[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL] html, if you have the time you will understand the kind of brutal president we have.\\n \\n\\nBefore the sudden death of my father, he foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe and decided to make a deposit SUM OF$30 MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS)in disguise as consignment in a box with a Security Company in European  . And he was forced to disclose this to me alone as his first son. And with faith, I am going to disclose the details to you,  hoping that you will understand me and keep the secret to yourself, and most importantly to stand as the beneficiary to this fund, so that non of my country people we have any reason to track this money back. \\n\\n\\nThis money was deposited as family valuables due to the heat of the problem in Zimbabwe , so that the government will not try to confiscate the money if discovered. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland . The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President \"MR. ROBERT MUGABE\" introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my Father was one of the victims. And because of this development I flew to Dubai to stay as a refugee. \\n\\n\\n>From the studies I have been able to make in Dubai concerning the right of a refugee, a lot of question will arise if I make any attempt to claim this fund directly concerning my age. And for the fact that I will not like to stay permanently in Dubai due to there law of not issuing permanent resident to foreigners. I am looking forward to stay in a country that the law will give me full right with time. And to have a good guardian that is knowledgeable in business and investment. It is just on this background that I have contacted you.\\n\\n\\nPlease, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account as soon as it is being claim from the Security Company. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 10% is mapped out to re-in-burse all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 60% will be for me and my family investment in your country under your kind control. \\n\\n\\nNote that this transaction is 100% clear and risk-free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal base on the little advice my let father gave to me. The only thing am soliciting from you is the total assistance to make a claim of the fund on your name from the Security Company, and after which the money will be paid into your account in your country \\n\\n\\nI need your complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account.

I am (Ben Coroma  Esq),asenior staff in file\\ndepartment in African developent bank (ADB).I gotyour contact from a\\ntourist from your country who was in this country and transacted a\\nbusiness with our bank. When i was searching for aforeign partner i\\nassured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees\\nopportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars( fifteen million\\nU.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one ofour foreign customer \\nwho died along with his entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane\\ncrash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting\\nhis next of kin to come over and claim hismoney because we can not release\\nit unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the\\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we\\nlearnt that all his supposed next ofkin or relation died along side with\\nhim at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my\\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety\\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t\\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The\\nBanking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money\\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the\\nBank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin\\nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a\\nforeigner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We\\nagree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman\\ncolleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer ofthis fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, yourbank account number, your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or emailthe text of\\nthe application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any  atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made forthetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on this email( (00226-7885 7597)immediately as soon\\nas you receive this letter.

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent Nkono, the first son of  Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.\\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum.\\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. \\nNow the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this transaction with you.\\n \\nIf you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Security Company. \\nI have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your account, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, it is opened for negotiation. \\nI have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country.

BRANCH,\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3years and 10months  the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. \\n Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n \\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.\\n Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.\\n Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Wang  Qin\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n[URL]http://snura.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}
