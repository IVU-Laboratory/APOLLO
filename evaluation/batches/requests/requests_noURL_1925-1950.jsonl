A number of new standards\\nand commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing\\nWeb-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the\\nrange and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.\\n\\nThe goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web\\ndesign, software engineering, and information technology communities to\\ndiscuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and\\ntool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.\\nExpertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and\\nexperience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing\\nplatforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and\\nInternet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation\\nof form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the\\nWeb.\\n\\nWSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related\\nto exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not\\nlimited to):\\n\\n*   Migrating to Web services\\n*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product\\ncontrol\\n*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable\\n*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure\\n*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple\\nplatforms\\n*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as\\narchitecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites\\n*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution\\n\\nWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software\\nMaintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event\\nfocused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of\\n\"maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems\" nicely compliments WSE\\n2002's overall theme and goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

But it doesn't complain about linker  problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok. Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects -  naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of  libraries, API stability, ...

I took some time out to make  RPMs of GStreamer for it. All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt  repository in a new \"redhat-80-i386\" directory. The repository for dependencies is again called \"deps\", and the one for  the gstreamer rpms is \"redhat\", because this time around the base distro  contains all the necessary packages. A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at [URL]http://thomas.apestaart.org[/URL] Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms : a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't  have a -devel package for it yet b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve. Here are the errors: INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0:  undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin  \"/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so\" INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so:  undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0 I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib  reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must  be something straightforward that should fix this.

People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.\\nBest of luck\\nIain\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
