That's actually an interesting \\nproject with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the \\nwhole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; \\n- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. \\n&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal \\nwith data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? \\nNeed a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or \\nmay not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of \\nparsing FOAF files. \\n- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce \\nRDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are \\nevidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of \\ntedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make \\nheavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in \\nRDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have \\nbeen writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent \\nexplanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://philringnalda.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.aaronsw.com[/URL]\\n[3] [URL]http://www.w3.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Jason \\nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \\nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside \\njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \\ngeneral) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \\nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's \\nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \\ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. \\n\\n_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format \\nformerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. \\n\\n_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war \\nbetween RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. \\nSo today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It \\nisn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type \\ndoesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an \\nimpediment to mainstream acceptance. \\n\\n_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS \\n0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0.
