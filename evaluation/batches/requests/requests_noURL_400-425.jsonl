I've got enough bugs to swat, but I really look forward to it.

I wasn't saying\\nthat MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't\\neasy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way\\nthat \"changed the face of communications\".\\n\\nI'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why\\npeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\\nphone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\\npeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\\nother people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over\\nsending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or\\noffline) photoalbum.\\n\\nI don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\\nright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's\\none of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\\nview part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want\\n\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\\noffers.  I'm not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\\npeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put\\ntogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\\nthey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\\nit's just \"nice\" on occasion.

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what you sent doesn't support packages named \"kernel-smp\"). I'd also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec... probably \"--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp\". Sound good enough? The BuildRequires on \"kernel-source\" will also need to be removed because it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/ More ideas are welcome.

You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to use it. > >If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, >  > With winbloze 9x I used to deltree the winbloze dir and some \"Program > Files\" dirs, and install \"fresh\" instead of upgrade, while saving my > other data.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating \"/\", put your /home/ files back into place and you're ready to go. That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass \"pci=bios,biosirq\" for one of my computers to work for example).

Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse\\nengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular\\nthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third\\nparty or otherwise) was in development.\\n\\nAll of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the\\nprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have\\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\\nplace.\\n\\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.\\nBut when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of\\n\"known\" menu extras from Apple.

The bombes used for Enigma were electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And clearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this statement has any credibility at all. Greg.

You can now add \"rpm [URL]http://koti.welho.com[/URL] redhat/8.0 task\" to your sources.list  and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with  'apt-cache search ^task-' These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain  exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories  at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are  rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by  running [URL]http://koti.welho.com[/URL] BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an  apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything  with it. --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I find it annoying, though, that  alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently  running kernel. So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the \"TARGET_KERNEL\" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at least it doesn't have to be currently running. It's kinda hackish, so if someone has a better way to do this, let me know. gary --RnlQjJ0d97Da+TV1 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline; filename=\"alsa-driver-spec.patch\" --- alsa-driver.spec.orig\t2002-10-02 12:25:26.000000000 -0700 +++ alsa-driver.spec\t2002-10-01 21:23:19.000000000 -0700 @@ -3,9 +3,12 @@  # Comma separated list of cards for which to compile a driver  %define\tcards\t\tall   -%define\tkunamer\t\t%(uname -r) -%define\tkversion\t%(echo $(uname -r) | sed -e s/smp// -) -%if %(uname -r | grep -c smp) +%if %(printenv TARGET_KERNEL >/dev/null && echo -n 1 || echo -n 0) +%define usekernel\t%(echo -n $TARGET_KERNEL) +%endif +%define\tkunamer\t\t%{!?usekernel: %(uname -r)}%{?usekernel} +%define\tkversion\t%(echo %{kunamer} | sed -e s/smp// -) +%if %(echo %{kunamer} | grep -c smp)  \t%{expand:%%define ksmp -smp}  %endif  %define\tkarch\t\t%(rpm -q --qf '%%{arch}' kernel%{?ksmp}-%{kversion}) @@ -77,6 +80,7 @@  \t%{?_without_isapnp:--with-isapnp=no} \\  \t%{?_without_sequencer:--with-sequencer=no} \\  \t%{?_without_oss:--with-oss=no} \\ +\t%{?usekernel:--with-kernel=/lib/modules/%{usekernel}/build} \\  \t--with-cards=%{cards}  make   @@ -106,10 +109,10 @@  rm -f %{buildroot}/etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound    %post -n alsa-kernel%{?ksmp} -/sbin/depmod -a +/sbin/depmod -a -F /boot/System.map-%{kunamer} %{kunamer}    %postun -n alsa-kernel%{?ksmp} -/sbin/depmod -a +/sbin/depmod -a -F /boot/System.map-%{kunamer} %{kunamer}    %clean  rm -rf %{buildroot} --RnlQjJ0d97Da+TV1-- _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Don't worry too much : The day the server gets too busy, I'll cleanup and publish the addresses of some mirrors, as many ftp mirrors exist (I'm aware of at least 15), and even an apt one :-) For now, the limit is far enough : When I unlocked the Psyche ISO images on Monday, the bandwidth usage on the current (ftp|http|rsync) freshrpms.net server went up to 90Mbps sustained, which is not bad as the server has a 100Mbps physical NIC!
