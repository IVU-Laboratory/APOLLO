I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of\\nauditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an\\nabandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to\\none of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in\\nnovember 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his\\nnext of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot\\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation\\nto the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but\\nunfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation\\ndied alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my\\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and\\nI don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed\\nBill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money\\nremained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered\\ninto the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is\\noccasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a\\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,\\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set\\naside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for\\nme . There after I will visit your country with my family for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of\\nkin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account\\nnumber,\\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where in the money will be remitted .\\n\\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or\\nby email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide\\nmaterials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment\\nformalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official\\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international\\nresponsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction\\nprovided you display maturity.\\n\\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\\nemail address .\\n\\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\\n\\nYours sincerely.\\n\\nMR.

I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal, now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal.   I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October  1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS: ([URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB.   My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.   This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.    Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.   Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.   I await your reply. Mrs. Saleh Galal\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \\nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \\ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \\nrewards for both of us.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \\nThousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of \\nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \\nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \\nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \\nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as \"unclaimed fund\". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \\n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \\nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\\n\\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \\nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \\nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \\ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \\nof your reply,\\n\\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \\nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \\nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \\nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \\nreceive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nibrahim mussa,\\nBill and exchange manager,\\nAfrican Development bank ADB\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Live.com : le nouveau moteur de recherche par Messenger! \\n[URL]http://www.windowslive.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal\\n Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Regime of\\n 1993-\\n 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and\\n trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is\\n presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite\\n surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your\\n contact from a business site on the internet and following the\\n information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of\\n assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency\\n required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the\\n country. During the time my father was in the government with the late\\n General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in\\n several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the\\n deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation\\n of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to\\n embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put\\n a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s government to\\n retain\\n power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum\\n Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies\\n Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news,\\n you would understand better. During this period my father was able to\\n make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.\\n The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the\\n money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman,\\n Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets\\n were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive\\n governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and\\n repatriated\\n from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the\\n money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million\\n Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign\\n account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private\\n security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the\\n Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating\\n agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M,\\n which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to\\n lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS\\n (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also\\n the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.\\n Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father\\n has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my\\n Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure\\n that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.\\n With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on\\n this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough\\n homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to\\n the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the\\n modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our\\n safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be\\n absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.\\n If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email\\n for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.\\n All my fathers\\\\\\\\\\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the\\n pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"it is at the time\\n of problems that you know your true friends\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So long as you keep\\n everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your\\n assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds\\n after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable\\n business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this\\n happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source\\n of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in\\n assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and\\n positive response.\\n\\n BEST REGARDS,\\n\\n\\n MR TUNDA USENI\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\nFree Email Service\\n[URL]http://www.zapo.net[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you.\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration of four years (4yrs) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. \\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem ,all that is required from you at\\nthis stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been\\nmade the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.\\n\\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.\\n\\nShould you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address  and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below  (pui1900@business1.com)  and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\nYour earliest response to this letter will be\\nappreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Cheung Pui\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nCorreo enviado por El Club de Tratlon de Tres Cantos\\n- [URL]http://www.traitlontrescantos.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
