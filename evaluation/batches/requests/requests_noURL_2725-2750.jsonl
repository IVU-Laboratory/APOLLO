This is one. Why you ask? Because home loan rates are headed up. Have you locked in the lowest rate, in almost thirty years, for your present home loan? Rates haven't been this low in a long time. They may well never be this low again. This is your chance to secure a better future. You could literally save enough money to buy that new car you've been wanting or to take that special vacation. Why wouldn't you jump at this chance? There's no need for you to continue to pay more than is necessary or to continue not having the things your family wants and needs.    We're a nationwide mortgage lender. We're N0T a broker. And we can guarantee you the best rate and the best deal possible for you. But only if you take action today.   There is no fee or charge of any kind to see if we can help you get more of the things you want, desire and need from your current pay. You can easily determine if we can help you in just a few short minutes. We only provide information in terms so simple that anyone can understand them. You won't need to be a lawyer to see the savings, this we promise.   We offer both first and second home loans and we will be happy to show you why your current loan is the best for you. 0r why you should replace it. And once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.  Take a couple of minutes and use the link below that works for you. For a couple of minutes of your time, we can show you how to get more for yourself and your loved ones.

I am contacting you concerning a customer and an\\ninvestment placed under our banks management; as a matter of fact it was 3\\nyears ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this\\nmail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information\\nyou come by as a result of this email.I contacted you independently of our\\ninvestigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like\\nto intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to\\nyou.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank to\\nengage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services\\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37\\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over\\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made\\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief\\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially\\ngiven the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on\\nnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however I\\nencouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The\\nfavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on\\n600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative\\ninvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various\\nopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of\\noperation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this point\\nat over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full\\npotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on\\ninvestments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he\\nneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He\\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in\\nEurope.I informed him that our bank would have to make special\\narrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process,\\nthe bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for\\nbanking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later\\ncame around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was\\nasking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict\\nsince the incidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland\\nEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts\\ndeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that\\nhandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate\\naccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar\\nespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line\\nwith instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money\\nthere in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was\\nthe last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002.\\nIn June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of\\nthe inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding\\nposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the\\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and\\nI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I\\nmade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of\\nlocating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four\\ndays later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently\\ndead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather more\\ninformation and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately\\nlaunched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert\\nabout the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you\\nare familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our\\nservices usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from\\nconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In\\nthe field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will\\nknow of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors\\nuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives\\nthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I\\nsaid, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart\\nfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in\\nour care, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\\nshould have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several\\nmonths were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private\\ninvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is\\nthis investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact\\ndetails and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a\\npotential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliated\\nwith this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that I\\nam the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to\\nreceive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being\\na foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died\\nwith no known or identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the\\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late\\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the\\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to\\nour bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert\\nthe deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering our\\nbank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out\\nof the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have\\nmy way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I\\nwant you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking\\nworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.\\nThe world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for\\nthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you\\nshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I\\npropose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the deposit\\ndetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them\\nto do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the\\nfinance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer\\nconcluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions\\nin relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The\\nfinance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the\\ndeposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to\\nany party that comes forward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of\\nthe deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family\\nbut however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I am\\nprepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to\\nrelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt\\nof the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no\\nmore; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them\\nrelease the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.I would\\nhave gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have\\ndrawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit,\\nbut on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as\\nthe beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have\\nthe deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank\\nof the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then\\nofficially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to\\nrelease the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The\\nalternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another\\nbank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to\\nthink of receiving the money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the\\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in\\nthis project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do\\nnot be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you,\\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy my\\ncareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this\\nbut people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations\\nrun the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, I\\ndo not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to\\nunderstand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot\\nlet this chance pass me by and I hope you understand, because for once I\\nfound myself in total control and face to face with my destiny.\\n\\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance,\\nif you will not work with me please let me know, and hence move on with my\\nlife, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and this is an occasion to\\nprovide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project\\nand it is a task well worth undertaking, I have evaluated the risks and\\nthe only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and\\nalerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this situation, good\\nfortune will bless you and plant you into the center of relevance in my\\nlife, lets share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me\\nspecifically, through this email account (wang6qin@yahoo.com.hk), if you\\ngive me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a\\nconclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition should\\nyou contact me via official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and\\nabout this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our\\nofficial lines neither do I want you contacting me through my official\\nemail account. Contact me only through this email address above; I do not\\nwant any direct link between you and me.My official lines are not secure\\nlines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer\\ncare in line with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this\\ninstruction religiously.\\n\\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two kids, I\\nsend you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the\\nconsequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is\\nnothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter\\nof gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking\\nclients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, I shall\\nhave the pleasure of meeting you after this task has been completed plan a\\nmeeting, soon.\\n\\nI await your response.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nQin.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I know how you feel\\n- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise \\nequipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose\\neither. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less\\nweight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Oh geez, not another\\nmiracle diet pill!\" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but \\nmy sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, \\nso I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing \\nto lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was\\nthe best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,\\nas I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds\\nto 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet\\nat all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!\\n\\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer\\nand received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel\\nthe need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it\\ndoes so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.\\nI am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'\\nabsolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!\\n\\nIf you are frustrated with trying other products, without having \\nany success, and just not getting the results you were promised,\\nthen I recommend the only product that worked for me - \\n'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!\\n\\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Ok, so how does this stuff\\nactually work?\"\\n\\nExtreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which \\nis scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid \\nweight loss. No \"hocus pocus\" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! \\n\\nHere is the bottom line ...\\n\\nI can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without\\nexercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. \\nJust try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence \\nto gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my\\npledge to you.\\n\\nBONUS!
