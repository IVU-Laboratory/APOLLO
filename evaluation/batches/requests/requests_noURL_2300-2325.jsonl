Last year,{Jan. 2006} my master died of a serious illness, but before his death, he told me in confidence of a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27,000,000.00) which he concealed in two trunk boxes and  deposited with a finance House in Cote D\u2019Ivoire. However, the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk to be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for export. Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health, he was afraid that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me that if he dies, I should try everything within my capability to make sure that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less privileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this deposit to me with a written instruction.  I have contacted the finance house over this issue, but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me, unless I bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLER'S relatives. This is a very tough situation for me, because since I lived with my master, he has not mentioned any of his family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you to the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining..\\nIf you can handle this with me, kindly respond back immediately and we will negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.\\nThanking you for your cooperation.\\nMiriam\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLive Earth is coming.\u00a0 Learn more about the hottest summer event - only on MSN.\\n[URL]http://liveearth.msn.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a \\nbusiness transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end \\nof the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nMr Mohamat Ali.\\n\\nMOBILE: ( 00226 78 82 97 88 )\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

This has created a whole new  marketplace in the Indian cable industry. Once this bill is made an act, it will  be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels through a set-top  box.India has an estimated 38 million cable homes! The  implementation of this change will require massive investments in set-top boxes,  conditional access software and the upgradation of headend networks - a great  oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your products at the  11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an opportunity to meet  all your\u00a0 targetted visitors under a single  roof.Other exhibits will be from  various industries including high speed networking, internet telephony, mobile  and satellite communications, network infrastructure, optical access networking,  portable communication devices, t&m and interactive media, VoIP, wireless  access, 3G, m-commerce, multimedia broadband services via satellite, conditional  access technologies, satellite receivers and transmitters, encoders, decoders,  and the latest in broadcast, cable and satellite equipment,\u00a0mobile phone  accesories\u00a0 etc.We  successfully concluded the 10th Convergence India 2002  exhibition and conference at New Delhi - the event had\u00a0176 exhibitors from  17\u00a0countries displaying their equipment and technologies to a discerning  audience of\u00a016,093 visitors from the industry, government, related trade  associations.

I am the manager of bill and\\nexchange at the foreign remittance department of\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)I am writing to seek\\nyour interest over a transaction.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of\\n$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In an\\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customer\\nwho died along with his entire family in November\\n2001  in a plane crash. Since we got information about\\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to\\ncome over and claim his money because we cannot\\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our\\nbanking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin   or relation died\\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody\\nbehind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one\\nother official in my department have decided to make\\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to\\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is\\ncoming for it and we dont want this money to go into\\nthe Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if\\nsuch money remained unclaimed after five years, the\\nmoney will be transferred into the Bank's treasury as\\nunclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of\\nkin in this business is occasioned by the fact that\\nthe customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot\\nstand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as\\nforeign partner, in respect to the provision of a\\nforeign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses\\nincurred during the business and 50 % would be for me\\nand my colleague. There after I will visit your\\ncountry for disbursement of the fund according to the\\npercentages indicated in this proposal. Therefore to\\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as\\nrelations or next of kin of the deceased indicating\\nyour bank name, your bank account number, your private\\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where in the money will be\\nremitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by\\nemail the text of the application. I will not fail to\\nbring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch\\nfree and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for\\nthe transfer .\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you\\nreceive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully RAJI RAJI\\nBill and Exchange Manager,\\nAfrica Development Bank (A.D.B)\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of \\nthe will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the \\nEnglish Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this \\nissue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I \\ntherefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if \\nyou decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nPaul Spencer. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
