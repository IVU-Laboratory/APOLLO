However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are. Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - Tcl has had \"clock seconds\" (like gettimeofday) and \"clock clicks\" (high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out. >>>Chris Garrigues said:  > > From:  Brent Welch   > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700  > >  > >   > > >>>Robert Elz said:  > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the  > >  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  > >   > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify  > time,  > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to  > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  >   > Do you really think this is true?

I'm not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots, and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at, all the time... It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so... Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.   | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less    | than 48 hours.

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on again). Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things that I never saw happen). It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been there all along. Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is trivial. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as \"Little Chicago.\" \\n\\nNow 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. \\n\\nBut a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. \\n\\n\"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,\" Jose Sandoval, author of \"Mother Aged 5,\" told Reuters. \\n\\n\"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,\" he added. \\n\\n'Totally willing to help'\\nSandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. \\n\\n\"We're totally willing to help her,\" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. \\n\\nMedina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. \"She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,\" he said. \"She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true.\" \\n\\nJurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. \\n\\nMedical rarity\\nNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. \\n\\nOne of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. \\n\\nHe said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. \\n\\nHer swelling stomach worried her parents. \"They thought it was a tumor,\" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. \\n\\nThere came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. \\n\\nHer father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. \\n\\nSandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. \\n\\nMore offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. \\n\\nOne offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. \\n\\nBut within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in \"moral danger,\" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. \\n\\nBut Sandoval said: \"It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them.\" \\n\\nHappy ending?\\nThough physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. \\n\\nMedina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. \\n\\nAfter taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. \\n\\nHe died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. \\n\\nMedina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. \\n\\nShe appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. \"We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,\" said Jurado, adding he thought \"absolutely nothing\" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. \\n\\nHe said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. \\n\\nHe said its value was \"more or less $25,000\" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. \\n\\n\"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,\" he said. \\n\\nAs for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. \"I believe there will be a happy ending,\" he said. \\n\\n\"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era\\nof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the\\ncountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\\nprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands\\nand the Republic is destroyed.\"\\nAbraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col.

Habeus -- Why? [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get. Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with \"not spam\", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark. Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.           - dan -- Dan Kohn     -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com]  Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Just a few notes:  - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone    in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a    good example) even if they do officially \"respect\" copyright law.  - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court    case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!  - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen    cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I    don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,    some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,    \"pump and dump\" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly    required for the spammer to get their way.

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that  look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still  mean that \"The U.N. is going to invade America!\" spams with SWE would get  through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like  Nigerian scams. --  Give a man a match, and he'll be warm for a minute, but set him on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life.

The main way that \\nspammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, \\nbut by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that \\nspammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the \\noriginating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, \\nand the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many \\nISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.\\n\\nOne would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, \\nand mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a \\nfairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his \\nmeatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once \\nyou have legal recourse to subpoena records.\\n\\n--B\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing \\nreal-time communications platform!
