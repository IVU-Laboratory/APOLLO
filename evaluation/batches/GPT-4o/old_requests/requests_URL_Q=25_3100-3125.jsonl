In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1996, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.\\n          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.\\n            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.\\n          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.\\n\\nPersonal Regards,\\nMr. Jun Cheng\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent to Webmaster.\\n- [URL]http://www.1stpd.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

I never responded\\nto one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\\ndoing had I not.

Due to the popularity of this letter on\\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\\nnot the program was legal.\\n\\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\\nthe program and if people can 'follow the simple\\ninstructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks\\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\\nBETTER THAN EVER.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n==================================================\\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let's\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That's 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper.

My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn't a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\\n\\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n=================================================\\n\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\\n\\n=================================================\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\\nof our technical ability.\\n\\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\\nnever be used again.\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1996, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.\\n          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.\\n            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.\\n          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.\\n\\nPersonal Regards,\\nMr. Jun Cheng\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent to Webmaster.\\n- [URL]http://www.1stpd.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}
