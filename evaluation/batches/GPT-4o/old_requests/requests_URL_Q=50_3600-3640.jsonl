I don'tlikethe wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedmefor a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbasedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhereto go.~~~~Thiswas a neat site. The site was original and I could tell that Mrs.T certainlyseemsto enjoy working on her site. The graphics were pretty, or funny,dependingon each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedtheleft rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.Also, I thinkusinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehowthefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothesite content helps when new visitors visit.Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.Onyourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehindthat would work better.Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasiertodeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof whichIvisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,mostofit is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play -goodforsmaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and Iwouldrecommendthis site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTEON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Helpout the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOURfavorite!Youcan help out Teddy at [URL]http://www.links4profit.comby[/URL] taking alookat his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBayDesigns [URL]http://AkkaBay.com[/URL] has designedspecificallyforhim.

I bet you can't click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt's that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \\nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \\nDon't worry, it's not!

I am \\ndeaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the bream! set which also \\naffected my brain, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating \\nand it is quite obvious that according to my doctors they have advised me \\nthat I may not live for the next six months, this is because the cancer \\nstage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought upfrom a motherless \\nbaby&#65533;s home, married to my late husband for twenty years without a \\nchild. My husband died in a fatal motor accident.Before his death we were \\ntrue Christians.\\n\\nSince his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited \\nbelongings and deposited the sum of US$3 million dollars with a Security \\nCompany here in Abidjan. Presently this money is still with them and the \\nmanagement just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the \\nmoney or issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my \\nbehalf since I can not come over because of my illness. Presently I'm with \\nmy lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer \\nof the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told \\nme that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that \\nthis money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed \\neach year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless \\nbaby&#65533;s home where I come from. I want you God fearing to also use \\nthis money to fund churches, orphanages and widows.\\n\\nIf you are interested, please respond back to my proposal so that I will \\ngive you security firm contact, They will issue you the letter of authority \\nthat will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund. Please assure me \\nthat you will act accordingly as I stated herein.\\n\\nFull names_________________\\nContact Address________________\\nTelephone/fax numbers____________\\n\\nGod bless you.\\n\\nYours in Christ,\\nMrs. Rose D.

I am the credit manager in a bank here in the Republic of Benin. I am contacting you with regard to transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a\\ntransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.\\n\\nPROPOSITION;\\nI am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident\\nhimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n\\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in \\nyour favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills and\\nthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. \\n\\nIt may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please\\nacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.\\n\\n1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.\\n2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. We shall be compensating you with 25% on final conclusion of this project, we have set aside 5% for expenses and 70% shall be for my colleagues and I.\\nI intend to retire after the conclusion of this\\ntransaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endevour to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed\\non you,\\n\\nI await your urgent mail to my personal Email:julliet06@3xl.net\\n\\nRegards,\\nMrs Julliet Abrams\\nTel: 00229 07 14 19\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nFaites un voeu et puis Voila !

In my department we discovered an \\nabandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US \\ndollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. \\nRICHARD BURSON from Florida, U.S.A) who died along with his entire family on \\nNovember 1999 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash you can \\nvisit this site: [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that \\nthe money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for \\nit and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed \\ndormant fund.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a \\nforeigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a \\nforeigner.\\n\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your \\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to \\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply \\nfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a \\ntext of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the \\ntext of application form,I will like you to send me the following \\ninformatios\\n\\n1.NAME IN FULL:................................\\n2.ADDRESS:.......................................\\n3.NATIONALITY:...................................\\n4.AGE:.............................................\\n5.Sex..............................................\\n6.OCCUPATION:......................................\\n7.MARITAL STATUS:..................................\\n8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................\\n9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................\\n\\nso i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective \\ncommunication.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application form.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I am contacting you concerning a customer  \\nand an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  \\nfact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  \\nthe contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  \\nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  \\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  \\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  \\ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  \\nto engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  \\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  \\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  \\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  \\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  \\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  \\nespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  \\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  \\nand however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  \\nprime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  \\nby assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  \\nmanagers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  \\nmoney around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  \\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  \\nstood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  \\nmargin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  \\nguaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  \\nmoney be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  \\nrequiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  \\nfunds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  \\nour bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  \\nin order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  \\n9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  \\ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  \\nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  \\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  \\nincidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  \\nmainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  \\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  \\ndeposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  \\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  \\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  \\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  \\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  \\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  \\ndeposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  \\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  \\nwe had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  \\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  \\nthat particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  \\nwas concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  \\nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  \\nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  \\nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  \\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  \\nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  \\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  \\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  \\nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  \\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  \\nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  \\nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  \\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  \\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  \\nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  \\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  \\nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  \\naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  \\nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  \\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  \\nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  \\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  \\ncare, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have  \\npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  \\ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate, this  \\ninvestigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  \\ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  \\nget to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  \\nin my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  \\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  \\nestate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  \\ndeceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  \\nsupervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  \\nof the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  \\nhave considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  \\nor identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  \\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  \\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  \\nthe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  \\nclaim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  \\nprobably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  \\nmoney entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  \\nout of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  \\nThis will not happen if I have my way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  \\nbut I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  \\nbanking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  \\naberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  \\nhuge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  \\nportfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  \\ndirection of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  \\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  \\none unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  \\nthis deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  \\ntransaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  \\nto the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  \\njust customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  \\nidea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  \\nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  \\nforward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  \\nof the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  \\nfamily but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  \\nI am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  \\nto release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  \\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  \\nhalf and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  \\nkin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  \\nproceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  \\nme, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  \\nin claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  \\nforeigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  \\nclaim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  \\nfew days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  \\nfile relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  \\nthe finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  \\nwith these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  \\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  \\nholder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  \\nthe money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  \\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  \\nin this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  \\nyou do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  \\nto you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  \\nnot destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  \\nmay not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  \\ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  \\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  \\nmay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  \\ndictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  \\nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  \\nunderstand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  \\nto face with my destiny.\\n\\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  \\nchance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  \\nmove on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  \\nthis is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  \\nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  \\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  \\nrefusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  \\nknows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  \\ninto the center of relevance in my life, let\u0092s share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  \\nspecifically, through this email account (mr.qin_wang@emanssv.com), if  \\nyou give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a  \\nconclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition  \\nshould you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny  \\nknowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you  \\ncontacting me through our official lines neither do I want you  \\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only  \\nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link  \\nbetween you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are  \\nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line  \\nwith our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this  \\ninstruction religiously.\\n\\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two  \\nkids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what  \\nthe consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured  \\nis nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a  \\nplatter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private  \\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one  \\naccord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has  \\nbeen completed plan a meeting, soon.\\n\\nI await your response.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nQin.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I have decided to \\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both \\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nDr Idris Ali.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWindows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bta ! \\n[URL]http://www.ideas.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        DEAR BELOVED,  I am Sussan Adams  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I\ufffdm now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer  problems.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.  I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.  Yours in Christ,  Mrs. Sussan Adams  Msg sent via CWNet - [URL]http://www.cwnet.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

NO, there is no catch; just send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.  Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then people send me cash in the mail for information that I just e-mail back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL. Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you must have missed something. \"AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION\"  \"Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, \"No Way!\" read the following. This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money.  The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way to make some extra money at home. And, besides even if you never got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth the money.  They can help you start and advertise ANY business on the internet.  That is, these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet. The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will understand once you experience it.  \"HERE IT IS BELOW\"  *** Print This Now For Future Reference ***  The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at.

Get what is rightfully yours. Program yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief system in place.  MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.  You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work.  The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. \"That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!\"  With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business.  Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others.  The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!  In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!  But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\"  Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not 'rip-off\" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me.  Here is the basic version of what you need to do:  Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.  In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done.  By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!  In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security.  If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke  P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur.  Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.  The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor.  As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.\" The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to \"move up\" or \"get rich\". Inflation will see to that.  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with \"NO RISK\"and \"JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.\" You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined.  Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them!  Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.  So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!  \"THINK ABOUT IT.\" Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA  HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$  This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.  Before you say \"No Way!\" please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office.  This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do.  1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't have them).  * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).  *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!  * When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.  * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.  2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps \"a\" through 'g\" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.  a. Look below for the listing of available reports.  b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!  c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.  d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.  e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3  f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.  g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.  Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,. 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter.  Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!  To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.  Here are two primary methods of building your downline:  METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL  Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about level five!  That's $500,000 alone! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that and more!  REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software.  METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:  1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50  2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500  3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000  4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000  5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000 THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550  Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants.  THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!  AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME ***  * ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of those sheets of paper include:  (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and  (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems).  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:  REPORT #1 \"The Insiders Guide to Advertizing for Free on the Internet\"  ORDER REPORT #1 FROM:  Randy Dillard P.O. Box 8  Osprey, FL 34229  USA  REPORT #2 \"The Insiders Guide to Sending Bulk Email on the Internet\"  ORDER REPORT #2 FROM:   Carla Brown P.O.

Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately.  * Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report.  * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.  * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!  * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!  ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of \"Would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment? Email me with the keywords \"more info\" to find out how. And, when they email you, send them this report in response!  If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!  THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!

THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.  ******* TESTIMONIALS*******  This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR  My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail.\" I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby. \" I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.  The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.  -Charles Morris, Esq.  Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.  -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA  I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA  This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
