I am sorry this mail\\nWill surprise you, though we do not know, \\nDue to the current war against white farmers in\\nZimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to\\nClaim all white owned farms in our country to gain\\nFavor for re-election.\\n\\nAll white farmers were asked to\\nSurrender their farms to the government for\\nRe-distribution and infact to his political party\\nMembers and my father though black was the treasury\\nof the farmers association and a strong member of an\\nOpposition party that did not support the president\\nIdea. He then ordered his party members and the police\\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will \\nDocuments has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit\\nKept in custody for us in a security company unknown\\nTo the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as \\nPersonal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could\\nEasily be found by his enemies. The total amount is\\nUS$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for\\nYour assistance to help us move the fund out of\\nZimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from\\nreality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of\\nInternational Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the \\nFinance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer\\nClearance above US$1M is just a few of the\\nUnthinkable things he is committing in my Country.\\nI have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.\\nJohn Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was\\nLeaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family\\nLate last year following this ugly development to no\\nAvail.\\nShould you be interested to help us, contact me\\nImmediately via email for easy communication and I\\nWill furnish you with the time frame and modalities of\\nthe transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of \\nCaring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that \\nThis transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will \\nNot endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%\\nOf the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any\\nAccount of your choice were the incident of taxation\\nwill not take much tool on the money and we look\\nForward to coming over to your country to invest our\\nShare and settle there.

JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign\\nremittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned \\nsum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with \\naccount number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who \\ndied along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska \\nAirlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read \\nmore about the crash on visiting this site \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great \\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery \\nthat I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank \\nto release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will \\nsend to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \\nsubsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this \\nmoney to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained \\nunclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years \\nand I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered \\nto our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know \\nthat the money is not transfered into our treasure.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by \\nthe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinab cannot stand as \\nnext of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering \\nyou 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other \\ncharges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the \\nremaining 65% is for me.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of \\nthe application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for \\nthis money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free \\nand that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have \\nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \\nreceive this mail through the above email.\\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY  YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT \\nREQUEST.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\nDR.

I am MR. JAJASHA ALI. the Manager of auditing \\nand accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN \\nDEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m \\nUS dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who \\ndied along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nanindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, \\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after \\nI will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number,\\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication \\nand location where in the money will be remitted .\\n\\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by \\nemail which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials \\nconfirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the \\npayment Agency. I willbe handling official\\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as \\nI am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.\\n\\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\\nemail address .\\n\\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\\n\\nYours sincerely.\\n\\nMR.

I got your contact through the \\ninternational trade and commerce (ITCC).\\n\\nMy name is Ibram Kamara the son of late Chief Abraham P.Kamara (the former \\ndeputy minister of finance under the ousted civilian government) who was \\nkilled and mutilated by the military junta led by major, Paul Koroma after \\noverthrowing the elected government of president Tejan. Through, I do not \\nknow to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbance in \\nSierra-Leone but the pressure of war drove my mother and I out of Sierra \\n-Leone into exile in South Africa where we have been living under political \\nasylum for years.\\n\\nSadly, my mother died of cancer 2 months ago and was buried here in South \\nAfrica . Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a \\nsecret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe \\nthe deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this \\nwas the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat \\nof the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it as a \\nfamily tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the \\nend of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a result \\nof his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the \\nSecurity/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.\\n\\nDue to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the \\nparticipation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will \\nassist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement \\nfor the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The \\nsecurity/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, they \\nbelieve that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. \\nUnfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the \\nconsignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your assistance. \\nI cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total ignorance of \\nthe business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your \\nassistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment while \\nthe rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. \\ni would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the next of \\nkin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i will not \\nbe allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by the \\ngoverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to open an \\naccount as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount of \\nmoney,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are interested \\nin helping me out of this my present situation, contact me immediately \\nthrough my email and i will funish you with other details you need to \\nconclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and of \\nbiliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing it \\nup.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also your \\nhome addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance company \\nhandling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will then \\nmake an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and discuss in \\ndetails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents for \\nnow,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to join \\nyou in your country so that i can continue my studies over there.

Although\\nwe never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a\\nhighly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your\\nprofile from a human resource profile database on your country.Though, I\\ndo not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile\\npolitical situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in\\nthe CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr.Morgan Yormie Wimpoe , from\\nLiberia, a Country in West Africa. My Father Mr John  Yormie  Wimpoe \\nformer DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My  Father  was\\nfalsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA\\n(CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.\\nyou can verify this from these international newspaper website below:\\n  (i) [URL]http://www.usatoday.com[/URL]\\n  Before he was killed, my Father instructed me to escape with my family\\nto a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that\\nhe left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name\\nwithheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist me\\nin claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security\\ncompany and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shall\\ncome over to your country with my Family so that we can start a new life\\nIf you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance  or why can't i take\\nthe cash transfer by  myself? The answer is that there  was an exclusion\\nclause in the original agreement between the company and my father \\nwhich states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have\\naccess to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred\\nto a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he \\nenvisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any\\nseizure or infiltration of the fund.\\n\\n  My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my\\npresent social status and total ignorance of the business world. I\\nbelieve you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by\\nplacing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request\\nthat you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.\\n\\n  On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you\\nfollow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee\\nof a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the\\nDiplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth\\n$32,Million,(Thirty two million United State Dollars Only). You will be\\ngiven 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be\\nwilling to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country.

I regree\\nt the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not \\nmet before. \\n\\n\\nI am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.\\n\\n\\nMy husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States \\nDollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.\\n\\n\\nFortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousa\\nnd United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. \\n\\n\\nThis money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad \\nfor investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. \\n\\n\\nDue to the current situation in the country concerning governments vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.\\n\\n\\nNote that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out\\nfinancial transactions without their \\nexpress permission is in force.\\n\\n\\nRight now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained in\\nconnection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.\\nHowever, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you \\nwill only take the commission that we will offer you.\\n\\n\\nThis money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still \\nbe used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, nei\\nther is the money traceable by the government because there\\nis no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. \\n\\n\\nThe freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as so\\non as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall \\nformalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement with\\nthem to air lift the consignment for your pick up.\\n\\n\\nBearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we \\npropose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for \\nthe expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out\\nfor miscellaneous expenses.\\n\\n\\nOn your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to \\nenable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must \\nuse this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep \\nthis matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.\\n\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n\\nMRS.
