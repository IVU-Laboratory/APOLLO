Before then, On one faithfull day\\nthree American Soldiers came to me and left a trunk box of Money with me and\\nswore to come back for it. \\n \\nWhen the war in Iraq intensified I was escorted to My country Benin Republic\\nWest africa, by the U.S soliers who felt the content of the trunk box was\\nchurch documents and never cared to check the trunk box,, when I was getting \\nfraustrated I returned to Iraq only to find out that two of the three Soldiers\\ndied in Battle while the last was decleared MIA (Missing in Action). \\n \\nNow I have the fund which belongs to the soldiers and which is Eight million\\nus dollars ($8,000.000.00),but i have deposited it with a security company\\nhere in my country Benin Rep, and I was contacted in a letter dated 10th of\\nMay.2006 by the company asking me to indicate if I was in reciept of the\\nletter as a sign that I am still living and still subscribed for their\\nservice.  \\n\\nI am interested in using a small fraction of this money,much less than ten\\npercent for a re-organisation of the work, but I do not need the rest and do\\nnot want to have any direct dealing with it, I need someone who will be able\\nto use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable,\\nI have thought of doing it my self but, my ministry is the apocalypse and I\\nbelieve and preach the soon comming  which make me not indulgent in reliance\\non money or wealth in any form. \\n \\nI also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe deposit\\nof the company that holds the trunk box, I will be glad if you have any\\ninterest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as you\\nprefer in your capacity like using it to help the motherless and people in the\\n3rd world countries. I will like you to give me \\nyour phone  number for easy and good communication.

The document of appointment was also a\\nSpecial Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific\\ninstructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from\\nEneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the\\npeople's behalf.\\n**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and\\nordered it nullified, which the \"kingdom\" has disputed.**\\n(Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an \"agreement\"? The\\nMarshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special\\nPower of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of\\nEnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll,\\nwhich lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no\\npolitical or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of\\nEneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not\\nincorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was\\nit subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of\\nany present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any\\nstatement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)\\nFinally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more\\nresearch, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of\\nEnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion\\nof Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before\\narrival of colonial western powers and missionaries.

While Eneen-Kio was well\\nestablished as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and,\\nhaving lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese\\ninvaders, kept control of it.

We have once more\\nadmonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for\\ndisregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased\\nreport. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding\\nthe Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are\\ncordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or\\nconcerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the\\nState Secretary of the Kingdom in reply:\\nThe Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No\\nclaim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any\\nclaim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in\\nthe world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the\\nancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual \"state of\\nwar\" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as\\nan honorable state among nations.\\nThe Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) \"asserting\\nauthority over land ...within the geographical and political\\nboundaries...\" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed\\nimperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of\\nEneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish\\nthere. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one\\nhas dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue\\nbe played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous\\nweekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our\\nshirtsleeves, our raison d'=C3=AAtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble\\nto\\nthe Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site:\\n[URL]http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org[/URL]\\nReferencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled\\n\"Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,\" of May 1st, the editor was\\nadvised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver\\nlicenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of\\nEnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary,\\nour Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so\\nsteps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are\\nadvised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such\\nan act is patently illegal.\\nThe published statement, \"The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap\\nMurjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...\", is wholly false. I\\nhave explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and\\nample information is available at our Internet site to refute the\\nstatement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its\\nterritorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to\\ntheir libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not \"created\" by\\nRobert Moore and he is not a \"Honolulu-based attorney.\"\\nHM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the\\nnorthern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of\\nhis own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens\\nwho participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and\\npeaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. \"Enenkio\" [sic]\\n(actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is\\nthe first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300\\nmiles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. \"Wake\" is a fictitious moniker\\napplied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society\\nwriters.\\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE\\nMay 4, 1997: News Release\\nSubject: Issuance of Gold Stamps\\nThe government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning\\nof its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the\\nFirst Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first\\npre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the\\nKingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997.\\nFirst day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official \"First\\nDay of Issue\" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time\\nfollowing the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are\\nencouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint\\nmailing list.\\nBACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the\\ngovernment was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution\\nin September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the\\nisland and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of\\nthe Kingdom lingers in \"exile\". Several nations have extended\\nrecognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship\\nare being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA\\nand elsewhere.\\nA NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake\\nIsland, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned\\nnames of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people\\nin the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the\\natoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant\\njurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and\\ncultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the\\ngovernment is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial\\ntitle to \"Wake\" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at\\nthe will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar\\nfashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful\\nreturn of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by\\nCongressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the\\nMonarchy.\\n\"STATE OF WAR\" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to\\ntop U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a\\nvirtual \"state of war\" now exists over the islands on account of the\\nblatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from\\nUnited States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to\\nrequest a Congressional investigation into actual events and related\\nfactors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific\\nOcean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the\\natoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom\\nhave fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal\\nadvertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events\\nand failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the\\nworld regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights\\nviolations by federal agents of the United States government.\\nINAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and\\ndreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium\\nnears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the\\nbasis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets\\nvaries according to the value and stability of national currency units,\\nthe stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with\\nany particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the\\nstamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be\\ndetermined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are\\nprinted on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended\\nfor use as money.\\nCLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people\\nfrom every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of\\nEnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In\\ndoing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the \"state of war\" with the\\nfederal government of the United States and asks that everyone with\\nhuman rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from\\nthe sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom\\nand end the conflict in peace.\\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE =A0TOP OF PAGE\\nMarch 31, 1997: News Release\\nAn official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top\\nExecutive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the\\nUnited States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts\\nthat: \"A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF\\nACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\" This is the most\\nrecent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One\\nof the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a\\nCongressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding\\nthe illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United\\nStates.\\nThis latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of\\ndisclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the\\ngovernment of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with\\nsimilar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the\\npremises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and\\ncompensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal\\naction have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal\\ngovernment. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal\\nannouncements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and\\nfailed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world\\nregarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by\\nthe United States.\\nThe land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three\\nsmall islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by \"Western explorers\" for\\nWestern persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue\\nis that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land\\ntenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal\\nchiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United\\nStates seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in\\n1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple\\nlandings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war\\nmissions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of\\nthe U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a\\ncable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the\\nEast. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was\\ndestined to become a military installation.\\nHowever, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President\\nby the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of\\ncorrespondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without\\nestablishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the\\nfirst World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood\\nfrom written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that\\njurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not\\nestablish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA\\n(predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base\\nfor its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called\\nannexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently\\nillegal and its \"ownership\" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.\\nWhen the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian\\nMonarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally\\nsignificant land to the \"natives\" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent\\nwas thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake\\nIsland. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak\\nchain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of\\nMicronesians living in the more \"hospitable\" islands of the Marshall\\ngroup. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was,\\nthe use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at\\nWake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby\\nactivities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or\\nquintessential knowledge by the American public.\\nEven after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian\\nMissionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there\\nbeing issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel\\nHermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in\\nsovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder\\nof the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title.\\nThe Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from\\naboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its\\nMarshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures\\nthe rights of ownership.\\nUpon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the\\nadministration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration,\\n\"yields to the recognition that a State of War\" exists over the island\\nnation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or\\nunconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom,\\nover all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that\\ntruth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of\\npower and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the\\nrecord of U.S. \"ownership\" and occupation. Native North Americans are\\nall too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it\\ncomes to seizure of land and denial of rights.\\nIn the Declaration, demands are made as follows:\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB \"...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an\\nhonorable\\naccord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...\".\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB \"If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to\\nsubmit to\\nImpartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR\\nreparations to citizens.\"\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB \"...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and\\nevery\\naction of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile\\nExclusive Economic Zone...\"\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB \"...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in\\ncommerce by failure the Department of the Interior\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB \"...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more\\nthan\\nTWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a\\nCertified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is\\nobligated to pay.\"\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB That the \"...Congress of the United States is obliged to\\nimmediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating\\nthe atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights\\nand due process...\".\\nThe government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable\\nnation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the\\nKingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God.

Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the\\nfirst press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake\\nI., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called \"no significant\\nimpact\" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature\\ninto and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its\\nsanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership\\nclaims.\\nOn March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the\\nnation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His\\nMajesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr.\\nRobert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution,\\nSuccession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted.\\nOn September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into\\nlaw by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the\\nUSA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the\\npeople. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent\\npeaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as\\nowner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and\\nembraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of\\ndemocratic government.\\nDocuments and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world\\nproclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were\\npresented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation\\nrequested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United\\nNations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others.\\nLetters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request\\nfor protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council.\\nOn October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent\\nvia certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding\\nthe illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the\\nislands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued\\ndisregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms\\nof the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall\\nIslands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged\\nreceipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now\\nin default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million.\\nThe second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994,\\nrelating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent,\\nonly two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands\\nBusiness Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then\\nonly briefly.\\nRequest for Media Response:\\nThe thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural\\ncalamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and\\ndeception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a\\nnew nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an\\naboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth\\nof Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about\\nsuspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the\\nsecurity and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of\\n\"world leadership\"? Or is it world domination?\\nPeople of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an\\neffort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,\\nhopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of\\ntheir ancestral heritage:\\n1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed\\ninvasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper\\nannexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized\\nby sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for\\nat least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and\\nvalidity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a\\nfabrication.)\\n2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of\\nspecific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack\\nthereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my\\nunderstanding Wake was \"decommissioned\" after the so-called \"processing\"\\nof thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).\\n3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war,\\ntechnological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds\\nagainst native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop\\nserious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.\\n4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the\\nking's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the\\ncitizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their\\ngovernment and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and\\nfiscal manner.\\n5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of\\nquestionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,\\noffensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,\\nenvironmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note:\\nCongress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island\\nand environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets\\nand missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less\\npublicized projects.)\\n6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with\\nregard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by\\nKing Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored\\nand respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human\\nrights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and\\nconventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal\\nto acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military\\nand colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology\\nfor the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year\\nand the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious\\nsignificance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio\\ncitizens.)\\nParting Shot:\\nWhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in\\ngeneral, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow\\nbehaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the\\nright to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest\\ninclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an\\napproach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner\\nof the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright\\nalarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent\\ntrail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,\\nforms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and\\nvirtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have\\nescaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government.\\nOur not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable\\nthirst of western \"civilized\" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry\\nof \"manifest destiny\" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a\\ncentury ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only\\nbe considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of\\nAmerican attempts at \"fixing up the world\". The title of ownership and\\ninheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States\\nby two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures\\nand recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from\\nmatters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in\\ndetermining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to\\nknow; the media a responsibility to show them.\\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is\\none, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political\\nphilosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives\\nfor correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human\\ncultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual\\nrights.\\nThank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and\\nforced exile of our proud citizenry.\\nTOP OF PAGE\\nNovember 21, 1994: News Release\\nIn a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands\\nwhich include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty,\\nKing Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister\\nPlenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of\\nWake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials\\nin October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing\\ncame on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the\\nillegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by\\nthe gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899.\\nThe legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value\\nand Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common\\nLaw and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King\\nHermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S.\\nclaim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human\\nrights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also\\nestablishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to\\nanswer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand\\nvalid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was\\nmade for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.\\nContinued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per\\nmonth through 1995.\\nWhile putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S.\\nofficials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which\\nkeep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory\\nexile.\\nEneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a\\nsmall orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,\\nincluding Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal\\nchiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for\\nreligious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC.\\nDuring the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and\\nexplorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the\\nreal discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the\\nislanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who\\nrecently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill\\nClinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian\\nMonarchy.\\nKing Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief\\n(Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the\\nMarshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll.\\nMr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the\\nislands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of\\nrestoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most\\nrecently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air\\nForce command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii.\\nNearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu\\nAdvertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: \"Air\\nForce willing to give up its hold on Wake Island\" and stated: \"Not much\\nactivity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control\".\\nAccording to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private\\nentities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a\\nstonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral\\nheritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people.\\nMr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation\\nunder active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate\\nand administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to\\ndirect all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as\\na limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive\\nCouncil.\\nSince 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the\\neffects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any\\nsubstantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers\\nand members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the\\nrecent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the\\nlawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios:\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al\\nGore\\nin February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in\\ntheir campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were\\nignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was \"decommissioned\" more\\nthan a decade ago.\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB In response to the Environmental Assessment of the\\nproposed\\nTheater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of\\nprotest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated\\nlaunching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into\\nthe waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered.\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket\\nlaunch\\nactivities and requesting help went unanswered.\\n=C2=BB =C2=BB A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which\\ndeclared the\\nstatus of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the\\nadministrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise\\nignored.\\nAfter waiting for more than 580 days since \"formal\" notification of the\\ndeclared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United\\nStates, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council.\\nThey, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied\\naccess to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of\\nSovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the\\nConstitution which establishes the democratic principles of government\\nrecognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his\\nfamily as the First Royal Family of EnenKio .\\nWhile the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of\\nforeign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included\\nagents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of\\nSpain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the\\npast, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the\\nfuture in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace.\\nThose principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the\\nUnited States.\\nThose tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S.\\nCongress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President\\nRonald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall\\nIslands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges\\nsuperiority of all Marshallese \"natural\" rights, including those of\\nownership and use of land.\\nStill mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military\\nmight and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations\\n(e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other\\nMinisters and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully\\ndisplace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His\\nMajesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document\\nwas the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up\\nin International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.\\nIn an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the\\nrestoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international\\nrecognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the\\nSovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent\\ndocuments of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations\\nSecurity Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations\\nand to the governments of most other nations of the world.\\nIt is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment\\nof diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and\\nrelinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time,\\nMr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to\\ninform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or\\nby contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is\\nmade to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of\\nEnenKio.\\nNews Article: Islands Business Pacific\\nNews Article: Marshall Islands Journal\\nTOP OF PAGE\\nReply to: EnenKio\\n\\nRobert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade\\nMission\\nDO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall\\nIslands\\n[URL]http://www.enenkio.org[/URL]\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing \\nreal-time communications platform!
