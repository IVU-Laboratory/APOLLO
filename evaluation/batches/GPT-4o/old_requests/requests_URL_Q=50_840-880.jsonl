Set in the old west.\\n\\nA cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly \\nsurrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians \\ntake the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the \\ntribe deals with their victims:\\nEach day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to \\ngrant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible \\nslow death. Time for your first wish.\\n\\nThe cowboy thinks a bit, and says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" So the \\nindians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the \\nhorse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a \\nbeautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, \\nappropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.\\n\\nThe next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at \\nyesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says \"I want to \\ntalk to my horse\". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in \\nits ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes \\nback, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy \\nand the women go in the tent, ..., etc.\\n\\nOn the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are \\neager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, \\nand the cowboy again says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" The horse is \\nbrought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, \\nstares right at him, and says -- \"Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!\"\\nOwen\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK. Kragen, do you know of any? I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org) that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post, no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting. For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin, or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them. So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even if it looks like spam. So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I guess I would have received it in a timely fashion. So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

Turn it off! It not only risks silent false  positives, but suffers them in such a way that  individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them.  Also, anti-spam startups need end-users.  Centralized spam fighting takes food out of those coders' mouths! I still think self-add whitelists are underrated.  A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with all subscribers, and grow from there. Bouncing problem mail, in a way that humans can understand how to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids  the problem of silent failures without opening the  door to lazy, forged-\"from\" spammers.  - Gordon ----- Original Message -----  From: \"Rohit Khare\"  To:  Sent: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 12:25 PM Subject: Re: HD/ID: High-Def Independence Day > On Sunday, June 30, 2002, at 12:18 AM, Rohit Khare wrote: > > You're all invited to join me for a South Bay Hi-Def spectacle at my  > > apartment in Sunnyvale on the Fourth! >  > So here's the final report on the HD/ID party.

People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'. Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff away Friday September 8, 2000 ... On the way down from the roof, through the \"workers' quarters\" which Van Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the subject of peasants, expanding on the \"worthless\" and \"lazy\" majority who make up the council estates of this country. \"You are playing up to your villainous image,\" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed. \"I'm not villainous,\" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard and hard labour is what distinguishes the \"riff-raff\" from the \"elite\". I ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, \"old-moneyed bastards\" whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as \"those rat bags drawing social security.\" ... He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the public mourning, remembers being pleased. \"I was glad,\" he says. \"He was only in it for the ego trip.\" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. \"She made us look like fools,\" he says. \"She made a mockery of the royal family.\" Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says gloopily, \"they are all we've got, so we have to respect them.\" He says he favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible because \"the power has gone to their heads.\" (Mugabe himself is the most modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming). Margaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made him feel \"proud to be English\". ... The 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a genuine dickhead. See also Mohamed 'al' Fayed.

This is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in my experience: 1) \"Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out of date at the next release in 3 months?\" 2) \"This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can call.\" The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has the patience to ask. The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company) and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge. Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales. \tJTS [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public ignorance about scientific matters. Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about global warming from human activities, no wonder most people \"believe\" that global warming \"will\" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% \"worry a great deal\" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13 environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those polled, was polluted drinking water. So What Do We Know? Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are three points we know from the science:    1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.       But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat) and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago, and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900 C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining past climate or making projections for future trends. Future Shock: The Scenarios When it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (2000), \"Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They are neither predictions nor forecasts.\" Further, \"The possibility that any single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly uncertain,\" and finally, \"No judgement is offered in this Report as to the preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations.\" Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's \" ... 40 energy scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics strongly bias their projections.\" Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate forecast. Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements of how the climate has changed in the last few decades. Complete Speculation On May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \"The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative. Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen.\" Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases where good measurements are available: \"For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ... that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35 million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important contributors to natural variability.\" Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000: \"The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have.\" This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate result. Think Locally Now, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on \"highly uncertain\" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular media, which would be where most people learn about the issue. The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002: \"Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability... Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated.\" The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, \"[T]here is currently insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections. For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for Policymakers, p. 15).\" A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations: \"Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such predictions - called \"verification\" - is simply impossible, since we have to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ... climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more significant impact on society than annual average global temperature trends.\" On the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or the experts? --  ----------------- R.

(AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory\\nfiling it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are\\nmore limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications\\nCommission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.\\n\\nAmerica Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable\\nwith others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be\\nincentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress\\nreports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent\\nreport, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.\\n\\nThe upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't\\nmuch closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,\\naccording to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing\\ninstant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an\\nAmerica Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of\\nMicrosoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using\\nthird-party software such as Trillian.\\n\\nAmerica Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized\\nfor blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The\\ncompany also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at\\ninteroperability.\\n\\nFor its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of\\nits users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other\\ncompanies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.\\n\\nWhen the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America\\nOnline wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced\\ninstant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to\\nenable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival\\nservices. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from\\nwidening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its\\naccess to Time Warner cable systems.\\n\\nAOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and\\nYahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.\\n\\nSpecifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a\\ntechnology known as \"server-to-server interoperability\" before it could\\noffer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services\\nto detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so\\nvia communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging\\nprovider, using a common language.\\n\\nBut in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said\\nit will \"focus its efforts\" on alternatives to server-to-server\\ninteroperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.\\n\\nAs an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to\\nmake its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service\\nfrom Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will\\nbe included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release\\nin August.\\n\\nIChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't\\ninvolve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of\\nmessages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat\\ncustomers use Apple software.\\n\\n\"We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short\\nterm, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide\\ninteroperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,\" Steven\\nTeplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to\\nthe FCC.\\n\\nAs to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan\\nsaid Tuesday: \"It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard\\nnut to crack for the entire industry.\" Indeed, users of America Online's\\nrival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.\\n\\nThe alternative solution \"was something that we could implement now to\\nprovide for IM communities to communicate,\" said Ms. McKiernan, adding\\nAmerica Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,\\nsimilar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.\\n\\nFCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.\\n\\nAmerica Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday\\nimplement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the\\ntechnology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus\\nDevelopment, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,\\nmsgs).\\n\\nBut America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was \"limited in scope\\nand functionality.\" True server-to-server technology \"would require further\\nsignificant expenditures of time and resources to develop,\" wrote Mr.\\nTeplitz.\\n\\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet\\nstandards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but\\nhasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task\\nforce representatives couldn't be reached.\\n\\nThe company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant\\nmessaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,\\nanalyst with Jupiter Research.\\n\\n\"It's still something the market wants,\" he said. \"At some point, it'll\\nhappen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.\"\\n\\nMr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively\\npursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user\\nbase. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground\\nbecause prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another\\nprovider, as long as they can reach America Online users.\\n\\nBut partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,\\nAmerica Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and\\nYahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL\\nhas denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its\\nsystem interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.\\n\\nBut the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are\\ncatching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base\\nrose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's\\nbase jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of\\nusers of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.\\n\\n\\n-Peter Loftus; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5267; peter.loftus@dowjones.com\\n\\nCopyright 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"BRA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
