Even then, those relics were well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.   Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.   Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.   It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.   The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store, runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away from the Microsoft monopoly. ...      - [URL]http://finance.lycos.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled  down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the  blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said  it's a simple resource change. Ted's code to \"ketchup\" made use of some of the procs that went  away in the sequence generalization.

I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just  now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to  forward me a clue feel free. Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that  my sequences are ... cluttered. --Hal _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist in general taking 5-10 seconds.  Interesting that a different wish comes up fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4. > Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen > messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages > rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.

As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \\nreally think I'm going to pick this up. \\n\\n    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \\n    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \\n    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \\n    high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \\n    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \\n    time is another story -- more on that later.) \\n\\n    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and \\n    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \\n    hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are \\n    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \\n    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \\n    own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \\n    34-year-old demographic.\" \\n\\nI am that demographic!

The first day's \\nfindings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: \\n\\n    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to \\n    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, \\n    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently \\n    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the \\n    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief \\n    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA \\n    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared \\n    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but \\n    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared \\n    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the \\n    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for \"Hell Freezes \\n    Over,\" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no \\n    more than a 10% \"reserve\" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had \\n    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) \\n    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they \\n    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.musicdish.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, \\n    and the guys begin to wail.
