After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some\\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future\\nmay be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to\\nremain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. \"Every major\\nindustry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar\\ntransformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the\\nmid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert\\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.\\nChristopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all the people\\nthat are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving\\ncarriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few\\nmillions.\" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the\\nlink at the end of this newsletter._\\n\\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)\\nhas only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As\\nInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this\\ncompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.\\nThis could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our\\nHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**\\n\\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.\\nA similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),\\nshare price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over\\n$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously\\nhad a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267\\nmillion.\\n\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for\\npotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a\\nfew months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an\\nincrease of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and\\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to\\noffer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building\\na communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will\\nexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market\\nwill return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,\\nIndia, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_\\n\\n\\n\\n**Particulars**\\n\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth\\nrecommendation list for the following reasons:\\n\\n1\\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions.

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some\\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future\\nmay be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to\\nremain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. \"Every major\\nindustry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar\\ntransformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the\\nmid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert\\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.\\nChristopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all the people\\nthat are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving\\ncarriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few\\nmillions.\" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the\\nlink at the end of this newsletter._\\n\\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)\\nhas only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As\\nInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this\\ncompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.\\nThis could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our\\nHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**\\n\\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.\\nA similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),\\nshare price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over\\n$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously\\nhad a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267\\nmillion.\\n\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for\\npotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a\\nfew months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an\\nincrease of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and\\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to\\noffer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building\\na communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will\\nexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market\\nwill return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,\\nIndia, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_\\n\\n\\n\\n**Particulars**\\n\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth\\nrecommendation list for the following reasons:\\n\\n1\\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and\\nmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to\\nsmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

DESMOND STEVENS\\n\\n                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. \\nYOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. \\nBEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERS MONEY TO \\n A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. \\nAS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE\\n  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. \\nPLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. \\nYOURS FAITHFULLY, \\nDESMOND STEVENS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}
