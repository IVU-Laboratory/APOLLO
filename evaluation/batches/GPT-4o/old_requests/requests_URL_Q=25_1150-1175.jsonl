Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the  interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can  specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and  come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning? > There are minor problems: like the serial console drivers, but for workstation  > installs I suspect it will work fine. I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the \"ok\" prompt)  is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you  should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed  cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all  (sorry couldn't resist!) valen@tuatha.org said: > side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't > work properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation > mode the Wyse is trying to do. hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console  when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at  9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much  really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to  look at the console at all.

Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate \\nwhen you'd like to do some changes to it.

I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being \\nable to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need \\nto set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom \\ntakes care of that part for you.

[ALSA stuff] [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        I wish I could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff hooked up :( so I so not know about it. I have an excellent ESS Maestro3 which OSS supports pretty lame so I was forced to learn about ALSA. I have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip: arecord -l   (list devices) arecord -L   (list PCM decices) I get some output like this: > arecord -l card 0: MAESTRO3 [ESS Allegro PCI], device 0: Allegro [Allegro]   Subdevices: 1/1   Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 > arecord -L PCM list:  (SNIP - craploads of output) I noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or gamix have. For what it is worth, here is what I have in modules.conf for my sound stuff: > ## ALSA portion > alias char-major-116 snd > ## OSS/Free portion > alias char-major-14 soundcore > > ## ALSA portion > alias snd-card-0 snd-maestro3 > ## OSS/Free portion > alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0 > > ## OSS/Free portion - card #1 > alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss > # BAD alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss > alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss > # BAD alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss > alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss > # > ## ALSA Options (optional) > options snd snd_major=116 snd_cards_limit=1 snd_device_mode=0666 > options snd-maestro3 snd_index=0 snd_id=MAESTRO3 snd_amp_gpio=8 > # > ## OSS Options (optional) > alias snd-card-1 off > alias snd-card-2 off > alias snd-card-3 off > alias sound-slot-1 off > alias sound-service-1-0 off > > ## Preserve Mixer Settings > #post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore MAESTRO3 > #pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store MAESTRO3 > post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore > pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store Hope that helps, good luck.
