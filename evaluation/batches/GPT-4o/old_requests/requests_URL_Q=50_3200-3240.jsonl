DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any\\ndata.\\n\\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,\\nthe 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable\\nmarketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails\\nlegally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch, much more.\\n\\nThere are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\\n\\n  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n  =======================================\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how\\nit goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out\\nonly 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing\\nreceive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much\\nbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people\\nmay send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each).\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.\\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each\\nfor a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and\\nordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\\neach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report #3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is\\n10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out\\n5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)\\nEmails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport #5.\\n\\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half\\nmillion).\\n\\n  Your total income in this example is:\\n  1..... $50 +\\n  2..... $500 +\\n  3..... $5,000 +\\n  4..... $50,000 +\\n  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00\\n\\n  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\n  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\n  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\n  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.\\n\\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,\\nor 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\\neach or more?  There are over 500 million people on the\\nInternet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people\\nmay do just that, and more!\\n\\n  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n  ===================================================\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there\\nare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of\\nfree ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD\\n# 2 as you go along.\\n\\nFor every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\\nReport they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day\\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails\\nthey send out, with your name and address on it, will be\\nprompt because they can not advertise until they receive the\\nreport.\\n\\n  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\n\\nNote:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.\\nChecks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash\\nis wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in\\nthe envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER\\nand the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,\\nyour NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper\\n'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your\\ncountry.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n=============================================================\\n\\n\\nReport 1: The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On \\nThe Net ...

My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  \\nI am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make \\npretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled \\nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the \\nwhole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \\npercentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody \\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later \\nshe jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, \\nand was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \\nthe thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within \\n3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days \\nshe had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I\\nhave joined Jody in her ''hobby''. \\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n===============================================================\\n\\n'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make \\nup my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that \\nI am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \\nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \\nleast get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my \\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large \\n6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this \\ndeal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply \\nisn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.\\nDan\\nSondstrom, Alberta,\\nCanada\\n================================================================\\n\\n'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later \\nI wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no \\nidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until \\nI was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed \\nthen it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I \\nmade a six figure income on my first try and all the money came\\nwithin 22 weeks''. \\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n================================================================\\n\\n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money \\nwith little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions \\ncarefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My \\nfirst month I made a substantial income and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanks to internet''. \\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n\\n================================================================\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON\\nYOUR ROAD TO GENERATING EXTRA INCOME! \\n================================================================\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\nThe sender or participants of this marketing program cannot\\nverify any monetary claims made in this document, nor do they\\nassume responsibility for same.

I am (jerry kaboreEsq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his   supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during   the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your\u2019s faithfully,\u00a0jerry   kabore\u00a0(Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.

ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. \\nMy husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. \\nMy husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. \\nDuring my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. \\nbefore my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. \\nI am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. \\nI hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. \\nWhen I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. \\nFor now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. \\nI will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. \\nThank you and God bless you and family. \\nMRS LOI C.

I actually decided to contact you due to the \\nurgency of this transaction.\\nPROPOSITION;\\nI discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our\\nforeign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of\\nan automobile crash. He actually deposited this funds amounting to\\nUS$40,000,000.00 (fourty million united states dollars), for safe\\nkeeping in my company here in Nigeria. Company file records shows that the \\nfunds was actually for a project. Our late costurmer wanted to start a multi \\nmillion Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA in the near futur,before his \\nsudden and untimely death. As such since his death none ofhis relations or \\nnext-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this property as the heir, \\nthis basically the reason why I have\\ncontacted you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\\n\\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\\n\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\n\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n\\n\\n Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. \\n\\n So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years and 6months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. \\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n\\n I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.\\n\\n Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\n Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Wang  Qin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMessage compos\ufffd depuis le module WebMail de REA S2 - [URL]http://www.reas2.ch[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Sani Abacha.  Because of my  strategic position in the former Government and also being a  close confidant  of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the  sum of  $50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only)  presently  lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money  largely through  \"CONSULTANCY FEE\" and Good Faith Fees\" paid by foreign Oil  companies prior  to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other  Lifting/prospecting Right.  Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in  the World.  As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to  Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability  has fueled  hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore  resolved to  invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties  and Importation  of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on  Investment.  However the, present civilian administration of President  Olusegun Obasanjo  has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the  cabinet of the  past military government. This is as a result of the panel of  inquiry  slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the  late former  head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the  panel  conclude its investigations which only God knows when that  would be.  Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present  two major  problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as  60% of this  money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result  of Government  deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However  arrangement  have been put in place for you to receive this money from a  trust worthy  security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate  your interest.  I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of  deposit number  and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the  onus of proof  to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic  Luggage.  All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money  on my behalf  and help me to invest as aforementioned.  There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as  the money will  be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.  If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by  email  immediately your preferred contact address where you can be  reached at any  time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in  a bank  account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the  investment of the  funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be  entitled to  25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the  proposed  company.  Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the  required contact address that include your telephone and fax  number), so  that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead  with the  transfer to you  Best regards,  Sam Aluko ------------------------------------------------------------ [URL]http://Game.37.com[/URL]  <--- Free Games [URL]http://newJoke.com[/URL]   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"CHN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn't even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I've used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt's time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of \\nthe will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred.

But the delay in\\ndeploying peace keeping force has worsened situation in\\nthe country. In spite of this, my country Liberia is\\nlike a herd of cattle without shepherd. \\n\\nThe rebel who see my family as a threat to\\ntheir ambitions, are planning to kill\\nevery one of us when capture.\\n\\n\\nHowever, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am\\nnot in any way interested in wars, this is why I\\nsecretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.\\nBesides, I am using this correspondence to seek and\\nrequest your assistance and cooperation in a sensitive\\nbut highly beneficial financial arrangement.\\n\\n\\nPrior to the Wars and embattlement of my father,\\nhimself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a\\nsecurity company\u0092s vault overseas on my name. The\\nfunds were arranged into a consignment before\\ndeposited with the security company but, the security\\ncompany did not know that the consignment contains\\nmoney. Because, the consignment was declared to\\ncontain family treasure and valuables.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that the I remain in the Asylum camp and we continue to\\naccumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment\\nremains in the security company\u0092s vault, made me\\ndecided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as\\npossible to receive these funds\\nfor investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use\\nthis money to safeguard my future.\\n\\n\\nIt is very essential that you understand the kind of\\ntrust and confidence I want to put in you.

Please, be rest\\nassured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free\\nAnd cannot implicate you in any way. However, I\\nimplore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost\\nsecrecy and confidentiality for security and safety\\nreasons, even if you do not intend to execute the\\nproject.\\n\\n\\nThank you in anticipation for your assistance in\\nenabling me achieve this goal.

I know you will be surprised to read from\\nme, but please this letter is a request from a family\\nin dire need of assistance. I am Mr. Ahmed Williams\\nfrom Angola. The first and the only son of Brigadier\\nChanza Williams communicating to you from\\nJohannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nI got your address from a business directory in\\nJohannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And,\\nI, on behalf of my widowed mother Mrs. Bridget\\nWilliams decided to solicit for your assistance to\\ntransfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five\\nMillion Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars),\\nwhich he deposited in a safe box to private security\\ncompany in Johannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nIn fact, my father said, and I quote: ?My son, I wish\\nto draw your attention to US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five\\nMillion Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).\\nI deposited the box containing the fund in a security\\ncompany in Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables.\\nDuring the war, I was very committed and dedicated in\\nwinning the war against the rebels, until I found out\\nthat the senior army officers and government\\nfunctionaries were busy helping themselves with\\ngovernment funds and properties, sending them to\\nforeign countries. Due to this, when the former\\nadviser to the president and I were assigned by the\\npresident (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in\\nSouth Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and\\ndiverted the money and share it, of which I got a\\ntotal sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million\\nEight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). In\\ncase of my absence on earth as a result of death, only\\nyou should solicit for assistance of a reliable and\\nsincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this\\nmoney out of South Africa for investment purpose. I\\ndeposited the box in your name and you can claim it\\nalone with deposited code. Your mother is with all\\nthe documents. Take good care of your mother and your\\nsisters.\\n\\n>From this words of my late father, you can understand\\nthat life and future of my family depend on this fund,\\nas such I will be grateful if you can assist us. We\\nare now living in South Africa as political asylum\\nseekers. Financial laws and regulations of the\\nRepublic of South Africa do not permit us certain\\nfinancial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest\\nthis fund in South Africa hence; I am seeking your\\nassistance to transfer this fund out of South Africa\\nfor investment purpose. For your assistance, we are\\nprepared to offer you 20% of the total fund while 10%\\nwill be set aside for any expenses incurred during\\nthis transaction.\\n\\nPlease note that this transaction is 100% risk-free\\nand the major thing I demand from you is to assure me\\nthe safety of this money when it finally gets to you.\\nFurther information and arrangement commence as soon\\nas trust confidence and good relationship are\\nestablished.

I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of \\n\\noperations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.\\n\\nI have an obscured business suggestion for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years ago. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.

The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED \\nTHOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)\\n\\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \\nBonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \\nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your \\ninterest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this \\ngreat business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nto the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money \\nto be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \\nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \\nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking \\nlaw and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed \\nafter five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as \\nunclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is \\noccasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe \\ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \\nbills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"top \\nsecret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I \\nconclude this deal with you.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in.\\n\\nAll other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from \\nyou.\\nI look forward to receive your email.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZIN\\nFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOU\\nBURKINA-FASO.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTen : profite de ton Messenger en illimit sur ton mobile !  \\n[URL]http://mobile.live.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I am the personal attorney to Late Eng. Sangeeta a national of your country, who used to work with Chevron - Development Company in Accra Ghana. Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 25th of December 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in Plane clash on cotonue. All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their lives except few people. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives. \\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. \\nI have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16.5 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next Thirty (30) Working official working days.  Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this account valued at USD16.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 30% to you and 10% will be used for any expenses.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my private email (tonywach45@yahoo.no)and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.
