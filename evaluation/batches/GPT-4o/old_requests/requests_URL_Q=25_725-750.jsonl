You can have a\\nbase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base\\nimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes\\nchanges to its own \"redo\" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance\\nincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the\\ncurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.\\n\\nThis is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the\\nhoneypots mailing list)\\n[URL]http://www.vmware.com[/URL]\\n\\nCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server\\napplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,\\neven before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.\\n\\nThe physical architectures of most production client/server systems are\\nlayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server\\nrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net\\nbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one\\nof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database\\nserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one\\npartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the\\npartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from\\none boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap\\nspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.\\n\\nWhen someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that\\nshouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or\\nApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But\\nwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a \"delta\" or\\n\"redo\" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the\\nredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be\\nminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from\\nbackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high\\navailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is\\nalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at\\nthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater\\nperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be\\napplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions\\n(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)\\n\\nDoes anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept\\nbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?\\nI use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in\\nthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server\\nsystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and\\nnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly\\nghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or\\nno) downtime.\\n\\nThanks for any opinions,\\nBen\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In \\nlate 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to \\nco-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens \\nof millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet \\ntransaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his \\ncompany for a king's ransom.\\n\\nNot bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.\\n\\nA programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to \\nChicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a \\nmission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure \\npasswords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded \\nPayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the \\ncompany.\\n\\n\"This company was founded on the notion of security value,\" Levchin \\nsays. \"Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.\"\\n\\nThiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains \\nfocused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good \\nfortune.\\n\\n\"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction \\nprocessor,\" Levchin says. \"We spend a lot of time designing security so \\nit doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. \\nThe trade-off is fundamental.\"\\n\\nMountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with \\ne-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, \\naccepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The \\nservice extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and \\nmore than 3 million business accounts.\\n\\nMost of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led \\nPayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. \\nAlthough they were once rivals, the relationship between the two \\ncompanies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition \\nof PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.\\n\\nLevchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. \"There are \\nareas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.\"\\n\\nAlthough security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's \\nability to carry out open communications among the millions of \\nparticipants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.\\n\\n\"This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to \\none another,\" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's \\nNext-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20\\n\\nPayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And \\nLevchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on \\nexploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst \\ncovering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.\\n\\n\"If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was \\nsusceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,\" \\nLitan says.\\n\\nTo combat criminals, Levchin established \"Igor,\" an antifraud program \\nthat monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin \\nsays building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. \"The \\nwork I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the \\nwork makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has \\narrived.\"\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying \\ntraffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it \\nreaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central \\nantennas, and improving wireless coverage.\\n\\nAs the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and \\nother devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless \\nnetworking may be inevitable.\\n\\nMesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless \\nnetworks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users \\nconnection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a \\ndial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection \\nspeeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The \\ntechnologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed \\nwireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range \\nprotocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even \\nfaster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.\\n\\nThe range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of \\nmuch use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the \\nproblem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. \\nEven though the range of any individual device is relatively small, \\nbecause (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, \\nconnections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless \\nconnection.\\n\\nBecause mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed \\nto create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building \\ncellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all \\nthat is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around \\n100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the \\nproper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by \\nsoftware.\\n\\nIt also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. \\nUnlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on \\nis unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too \\npleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds \\nacquiring 3G licences.\\n\\nAll that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect \\nto the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets \\nbetter, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone \\nnetworks.\\n\\nBut things get very interesting when you realise that when you have \\nhigh-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, \\nand mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing \\nmusic, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When \\nUltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.\\n\\nAt 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the \\nperson sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. \\nSooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of \\ntheir favourite songs, movies, and video games.\\n\\nBut the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. \\nMeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. \\nInstead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities \\nthat want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works \\nemployees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the \\ncheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for \\nenterprise networks.\\n\\nThe first place average users may use the technology is when it is \\nincorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at \\nhigh speeds, which both companies see happening soon.\\n\\nWhen will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in \\nyour pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service \\nwas initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually \\nsomeone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
