Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell ([URL]www.maxwell.com[/URL] makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag! On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut? ----- Original Message ----- From: \"R. A.

Not a bad idea at all, provided we avoid Texas's mistake.  If we get  two senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus  our fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting  block in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political  spectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the  current US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left  by the US political establishment later, we own the place. Byzantium, anyone? Andrew D.

Just under half the people\\n now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three\\n quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,\\n regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. \\n \\n That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per\\n cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared\\n with 60 per cent in 1987. \\n \\n Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on\\n what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published\\n today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on\\n interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. \\n \\n Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of\\n twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with\\n two thirds of pensioners. \\n \\n But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with\\n graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a\\n third less racist. \\n \\n That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from\\n and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a\\n powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. \\n \\n Mr Blairs famous mantra education, education, education seems far less\\n consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with\\n an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people\\n get degrees, degrees buy less and less, he said. \\n \\n But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the\\n undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, he added. \\n \\n He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just\\n political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would\\n give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. \\n \\n Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and\\n university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists\\n should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,\\n three times as many as those with no qualifications. \\n \\n It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report\\n says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased\\n contact with alternative points of view. \\n \\n Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their\\n idealism, but found the opposite to be true. \\n \\n Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong\\n with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He\\n said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older\\n generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. \\n \\n Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half\\n the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven\\n years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,\\n with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. \\n \\n A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,\\n and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the\\n chances. \\n \\n One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on\\n heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of\\n people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept\\n up to 97 per cent. \\n \\n The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal\\n free-for-all, Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. People are making\\n quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong. \\n \\n On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think\\n that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits  in\\n fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth\\n in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that\\n half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure\\n was 40 per cent. \\n \\n The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live\\n with their parents, twice as many as women.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\\n\\n \\n\\nYour use of Yahoo!

Then put this on\\na new line in \\n\\n/etc/modules\\n\\nin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do\\n\\nmodprobe nvdriver\\n\\nto load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the\\ndriver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the\\nnvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not\\nopen source).\\n\\n> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best \\n> solution?

Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.\\nAs it turns out, my French is crap.

X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two  approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently  `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called  an XIM (X Input Method).   WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on            my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,            and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese            script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! ***  XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you  build up your character as a series of composes of the root or  fundamental strokes (\"radicals\", I think they are called), and  then \"commit\" the composite character to the application.  ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe   a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!   and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )  some XIMs compose \"in place\", others do it on a special line,  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).  also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input  mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,  which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which  apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---  implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII  input mode (what us English-speakers would call \"normal\"  keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).  I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often  a toggle, and something like .  many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading. cheers! \t-blf- p.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8       locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called \"limbo\" release,       then you may quite possibility be using one by default. -- \u00abHow many surrealists does it take to    |  Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland  change a lightbulb?
