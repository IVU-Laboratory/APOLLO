The fake site was used to squeeze\\n more money out of people they had already hooked. \\n \\n The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,\\n (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being\\n taken in by the fake website. \\n \\n The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a\\n share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African\\n nations. \\n \\n NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would\\n otherwise spot the scam. \\n \\n Convincing site \\n \\n News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an\\n unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out\\n their victims. \\n\\n A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had \"the\" in\\n front of the bank's name. \\n \\n \"I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,\" said the NCIS\\n spokesman. \"It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced\\n online.\" \\n \\n Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people\\n behind it have not been caught. \\n \\n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \\n \\n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \\n\\n Domain games \\n \\n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \\n \\n The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\\n crimes. \\n \\n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \\n \\n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\\n it. \\n \\n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \\n \\n Cutting edge fraud \\n \\n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\\n legitimacy. \\n \\n \\n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\\n \\n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\\n place of the certificates. \\n \\n \"To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\\n technology,\" said the spokesman. \\n \\n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\\n Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. \\n \\n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\\n been deposited in their name. \\n \\n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \\n \\n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \\n \\n Modern gloss \\n \\n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\\n old cons a modern gloss. \\n \\n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \\n \\n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\\n true, undoubtedly is. \\n \\n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\\n service Paypal. \\n \\n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \\n \\n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in \"AllowDuplicated\",  meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same  time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one  version available. 'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it... --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer. > like mplayer not working also and gives black screen This is not normal though... Try \"mplayer -vo help\" then try usinf various output methods to see if some do work or not.

Programs such as mozilla and various others use these\\nfunctions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary\\ncode or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.\\n\\nThese new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory\\nleaks in reading image functions.\\n\\nSince most applications which display images use libpng, this affects\\nmany applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red\\nCarpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.\\n\\nXimian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris\\npackages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,\\nthey will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade\\nlibpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2.

[URL]http://wwws.sun.com[/URL] integrated into solaris.\\n\\nYeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum\\ncleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would\\nreally like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.\\n\\n> Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the\\n> interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can\\n> specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home,\\nand\\n> come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?\\n\\nEr, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro\\nspecific, anyway.\\n\\nI am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script\\nchanges. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.\\n\\nI do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are\\npicked up by silo. So:\\n  boot disk linux\\n\\nwould not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there\\nit is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be\\nautomatic from there on.\\n\\n> I don't see why this should be a _major problem.

Once the machine is\\ninstalled\\n> cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after\\nall\\n> (sorry couldn't resist!)\\n\\nThe problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty\\ndrivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in\\nprompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM\\non shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or\\nkeyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power\\nswitch hidden at the back of the case.\\n\\nI think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is\\n/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down\\nproperly.\\n\\n- Matthew\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\\n[URL]http://uk.my.yahoo.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
