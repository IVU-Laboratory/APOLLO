I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get\\nthat detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is\\nnot supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than\\nenough for 1 PC ).\\n\\nIt could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more\\ndifficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!!
