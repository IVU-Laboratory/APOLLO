(thread changed slightly) [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        hey, AFAIK it isn't hard at all to create your own modified version of the redhat distro.  There's even a tarball[1] with this specifically in mind.  The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball. Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO. It *is* a good idea though.  I've been  wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all). I don't discount any other work like for  example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right. Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure  in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other),  no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places  such a suggestion would stumble. Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring  a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging. That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox. Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun. Just a pseudo random thought. I'm only laughing on the outside  My smile is just skin deep  If you could see inside I'm really crying  You might join me for a weep. <> --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for  Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now. The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. \"In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,\" said the Journal. \"Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time.\" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United.  Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. \"The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions  to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,\" said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions,  which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring  $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration.  The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. \"The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees\" while \"European authorities have acted more wisely,\" letting Swissair and Sabena \"go to the wall,\" said  the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should  let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and Canada 3000.

These are companies that once referred to Linux as a \"bathtub of code\" (Sun) and \"a cancer\" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News. Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year. Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at  the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: \"Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.\" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft  will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- \"a place where  you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,\" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston:  \"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.\" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called \"Solinux.\" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon  Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system.

American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now. The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. \"In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,\" said the Journal. \"Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time.\" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United.  Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. \"The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,\" said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration.  The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. \"The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees\" while \"European authorities have acted more wisely,\" letting Swissair and Sabena \"go to the wall,\" said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and Canada 3000.

These are companies that once referred to Linux as a \"bathtub of code\" (Sun) and \"a cancer\" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News. Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year. Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: \"Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon.\" Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- \"a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,\" deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: \"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow.\" Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called \"Solinux.\" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. \"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,\" Poletti reported.

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!) However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary. But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is. You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001. And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a \"real\" company, etc). There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the source will always be free (or minimal cost). Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions.

What I didn't  understand was that SuSE had proprietary  extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence. I thought that the model for the likes of  SuSE was selling support and customisation,  rather than what I thought of as the core \"product\". I thought that the likes of Yast came under core - maybe it worked in the glory days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that they might want to make more money, but the way in which they have done it, seems to me, to be  be against the spirit of the GPL.   > You're further confused if you think the GNU  > GPL gives you the right to get covered software > for free.

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can borrow them, but not  copy them?

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say, trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears,  at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up proprietary and open stuff.   > What, you think that's too much work?

While not valid 100% of the time, it's a \\nreasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at\\ncode, it's easier to see how control moves through a \\nfunction if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The\\nspecific example of replacing a break in a while loop with\\na modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to\\nlook in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the\\nloop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular\\nexample wasn't really that good, since the extra test was \\nadding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.\\nWhich is much the same as a break really.)\\n\\nThe idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as \\npossible when he sees the code.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select\\nblock makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or \\none case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.\\nLeaving out break statements breaks this assumption.\\n\\nMy point is that, while there are a few situations where it\\nmakes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to \\nconsider the break at the end of each case more like the\\nbrace at the end of the while block.  \\n\\nIn fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language\\nwas designed such that the continue statement meant fall through\\nand break wasn't needed:\\n\\n   select (x) {\\n      case 1:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n      case 2:\\n         /* do something - falls through to next case*/\\n         continue;\\n      case 3:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n      default:\\n         /* do something - doesn't fall through */\\n   }\\n\\nStill, hindsight and all that.

They are deployed in a cellular  fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming. On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to  a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is  quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration. The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't  work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation  and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most  often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux  bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous  is broken as well). \" [[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge  our networks? ]] \" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC  headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the  right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on  how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in  hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points). In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or  wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about  turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. \" [[ Is this true? ]] \" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other  methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... \" [[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge.  But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right. Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure  in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other),  no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places  such a suggestion would stumble. Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring  a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging. That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox. Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun. Just a pseudo random thought.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...\\n\\n[URL]http://www.openp2p.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run\\non the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\\nimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is\\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\\n\\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\\nbrowser.\"\\n\\n===\\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\\n\"home\" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\\napplications.\"\\n\\n\"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\\nconnections can download portions, or \"stripes,\" of a file from several\\ncached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles\\nthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that\\nthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this\\ndigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header\\nfor the file.\"\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
