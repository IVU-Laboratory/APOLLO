On June 6, 1999, an American Oil \\nconsultant/contractor\\nwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a\\nnumbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at\\nUS$35,000,000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon\\nmaturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got\\nno reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered\\nfrom his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further\\ninvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all\\nattempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered\\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his\\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This\\nsum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\\never come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the\\nexpiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\\nNigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\\nforiegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the\\nfruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some\\ncorrupt government officials.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately\\nyour full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the\\nnecessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next\\nof kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for\\ndrafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and\\nletter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\\nWe would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of\\nkin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel and\\nclaim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regional\\nAfrican country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house\\nto the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio\\nof 60% for me and 40% for you.\\n\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\\ntransaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch\\nManager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.\\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via\\nthe private email address below. Upon your response,I shall then provide\\nyou with more details and relevant documents that will help you\\nunderstand the transaction.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest\\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\\nshall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please\\nfurnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster\\ncommunication. Awaiting your urgent reply via my \\nemail:ami44000@netzero.net\\nThanks and regards,\\nSWEETIE AMINA USMAN\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n________________________________________________________________\\nThe best thing to hit the internet in years - NetZero HiSpeed!\\nSurf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!\\nOnly $14.95/ month -visit [URL]www.netzero.com[/URL] to sign up today!\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Let me quickly introduce the reason and myself why contacting you is very important. I am Kalister Maunda; a senior staff at the Office of the Minister of Petroleum Affairs in Angola. I have traveled along side with the Minister of Petroleum to your country in search of investors that would be interested to invest on our Petroleum Sector, it was in one of this trip that I was opportune to realize that the trips been made by the Minister is not for the search for an investor but for the search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan petroleum sector that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this discovery, but I later realized that I was the only one among other top staffs that was not aware of these happenings, investigation into this matter made me to know that even the president is involved. I suddenly realized that the BBC and the Excite news achieve below is true.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://apnews.excite.com[/URL]\\n.\\nOn arrival from the trip I made with the minister and went straight to confront my Head of Department, of my findings and he told me that he is aware of the whole situation, he went further to show me some documents that was used to withdraw some millions of American Dollars that was meant to be used to pay Oil contracting Firms in Angola, he said I should assist him in the search for a reputable and trust worthy business man that can assist us in transferring the funds to a safe place where it will be used for Future Investment.\\n.\\n    I am therefore asking for your opinion on this issue, will you be able to assist us in transferring and claiming the money of which some percentage of the total amount involved will be granted to you for assisting us and for the time you spent on the transaction.\\n.\\n    If you are willing and capable to assist us kindly provide us with details of how we can reach you by phone or by fax so that we can proceed to conclude this transaction. \\n.\\nYours Truly,\\nKalister Maunda [MISS]\\nkalika@spinfinder.com\\n.\\nThe information contained in this email message is confidential It is intended solely for the addressee.

In an account that belongs to one \\nof our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday \\n31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, \\nwe have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money \\nbecause we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin \\nor relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but \\nunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died \\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department \\nnow decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to \\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \\ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to \\ngo into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \\nbusiness and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will \\nvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the \\nmoney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax \\nor email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice \\nthat this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any \\natom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as \\nyou receive this letter.

Dear friend, RE: TRANSFER OF ($8,500.000.00 USD EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS)I want to transfer to overseas the sum of ($8.500.000.00USD) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in Africa. I would like to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty  a/c can serve as far as it can receive money. I am DR AHMED SHALAA. an accountant and personal confidant to Mr.Robert Rice who died together with his wife in a plane crash on the October 31st 1999 on their way to attendwedding in Boston, he is an American, a physician andindustrialist, he died without having anybeneficiary to his assets including his account here in Burkina Faso which he opened as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company before his untimely death in 1999. The amount involved is ($8.500.000.00USD) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), no other person knows about this account. I am contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary, I want to transfer the whole $8,500.000.00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand USD)  into a safe account abroad, but I don't know any foreigner. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Robert Rice is aforeigner too, and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the inheritance procedures. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount,55% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Sincerely,Dr.Ahmed Shalaa.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWith Windows Live Hotmail, you can personalize your inbox with your favorite color.\\n[URL]www.windowslive-hotmail.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
