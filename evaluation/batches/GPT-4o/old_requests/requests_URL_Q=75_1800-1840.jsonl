Make sure there's a field in the database called (for example) \"Updated\" and when it comes time to generate the list, add \"order by updated\".  This'll put it in that particular order for ya.  You can also chose to order it by name, etc by changing this field.     This should be the same for both MySql and Postgressql (any modern SQL, really).

For example, the simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example, Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong', then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3. You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that much different to English.  However, until you get familiar with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can be a little slow. Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is 'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent 'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible matches. I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only use that when you know the character you want but you don't know how to pronounce it. >  >  some XIMs compose \"in place\", others do it on a special line, >  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?). >  also, some(/most?)

Probably most often Ctrl-Space.  That's what the Microsoft Global Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC. Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me on Red Hat 7.2 o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The    fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable    Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMs o  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging    in. Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your way around. Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When  in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space. Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and  you'll see the Chinese for China. Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.

Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct  behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing  list. But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be  the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get  hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense).  If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense).  If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose. Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority,  not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he  should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't  razor provide a razor-blacklist too?) \tJehan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the\\none guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the\\nmajority, your trust goes up.

A quick work-around is to do a \"chmod go+rx\" on that file (of  course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible). In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't  have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later  in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the \"unblessed\"  error.
