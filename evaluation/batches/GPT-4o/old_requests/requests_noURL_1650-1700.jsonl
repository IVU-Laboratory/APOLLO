I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions.    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.

Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills | itself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else. |  | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. |  | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the | vulnerability, if possible.   |  | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible | disclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was. |  | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible | disclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the | underground, vulnerable. |  | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible. |  | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.   |  | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if | HP retained Snosoft's \"consulting services\".  HP considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the | information. |  | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, | together, add up to a catastrophe. |  | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later, | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. |  | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be | --- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. |  | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. |  | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist. |  | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in | Samba, for example. |  | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. |  | Let's not let that happen. |  |  |  |  | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement: |  | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] | Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program |  |  | Greetings, |  | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. |  | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program: |  | Q. How will it work? | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number | of motivations, including the following: |  |          * Pure love of security research |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure |  | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following | items: |  |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided |          * The potential severity level for the information shared |          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other |            software and hardware potentially affected |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs |          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE |  | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other | entity. |  | Q. Why are you launching this program? | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the | public at large are warned in a timely manner. |  | Q. Who gets the credit? | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or | exploit information. |  | Q. When can I contribute? | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today. |  | To learn more, go to [URL]http://www.idefense.com[/URL] If you have | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please | contact us at contributor@idefense.com. |  | Regards, |  | Sunil James | Technical Analyst | iDEFENSE |  | \"iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively | monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and | hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. | The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline | security professionals and network administrators with timely access to | actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. | iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines | the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new | software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.\" |  | [URL]http://xent.com[/URL] |  --  \"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.\" \t\t\t\t\t               -Hume [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

LOGABSTRACT=all) it \\nshows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of \\nthis file, I use \\n :0fw\\n | spamc\\nto call spamassassin.\\n\\nAlso in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do \\nfor our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed \\nthat they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about \\nfuture lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made.

No forwards go out, no files \\nare made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the \\nuser/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun \\nexample above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other \\nmessages.

This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits. Description: The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger race in the dcache of the file system subsystem. This kernel update addresses both of these issues. In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following drivers: stradis rio500 se401 usbvideo apm Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had the capability to expose kernel memory when abused. All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the time of this writing, have any known exploits. We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar Designer, and others for their auditing work.

Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills\\nitself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash\\nfor information about security vulnerabilities in computer software\\nthat are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell\\nanyone else.\\n\\nIf this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a\\nvery serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.\\n\\nAt the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research\\nknown as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security\\nvulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short\\nwhile later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem\\n--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the\\nvulnerability, if possible.  \\n\\nThis method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by\\nCERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible\\ndisclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release\\nany information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released\\na patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\\nvulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\\non features, and often, even after the patches were released, people\\nwouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem\\nwas.\\n\\nThe underground computer criminal community would often discover and\\nexploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible\\ndisclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the\\nunderground, vulnerable.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\\nare much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to\\nreduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,\\nturning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and\\ndetecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less\\nuseful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see\\nsecurity vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so\\nprefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as\\nlong as possible.\\n\\niDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\\nthan either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in\\na marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding\\ndiscoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  \\n\\nNot long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently\\nincluding some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the\\nsecrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\\nvendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to\\nHewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if\\nHP retained Snosoft's \"consulting services\".  HP considered this\\nextortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the\\ninformation.\\n\\nIf this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,\\ntogether, add up to a catastrophe.\\n\\nFirst, secret software vulnerability information will be available to\\nthe highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,\\nI think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\\nsyndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.\\n\\nSecond, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\\nbecome lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be\\n--- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good\\nguys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority\\nof current vulnerabilities are kept secret.\\n\\nI've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\\nvendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's\\nplausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets\\nthem, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the\\npeople who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when\\ncredit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.\\nKnowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site\\nadministrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some\\nnegative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.\\n\\nI think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\\ninformation is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to\\nexecute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that\\nmeans organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who\\nare good at networked theft may not yet exist.\\n\\nThere might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as\\nMicrosoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\\nthan a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in\\nSamba, for example.\\n\\nRight now, people who know how to find security exploits are either\\nmotivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public\\ninterest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or\\npersonally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating\\na marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\\nincrease the availability of that information to the people who can\\nafford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.\\n\\nLet's not let that happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the original iDEFENSE announcement:\\n\\nFrom: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]\\nSent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM\\nSubject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program\\n\\n\\nGreetings,\\n\\niDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\\nContributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance\\nnotification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.\\n\\niDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following\\nprovides answers to some basic questions about the program:\\n\\nQ. How will it work?\\nA. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\\nsecurity research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number\\nof motivations, including the following:\\n\\n         * Pure love of security research\\n         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\\n         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\\n         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\\n\\nThe VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\\nInternet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the\\nwork.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following\\nitems:\\n\\n         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)\\n         * The amount of detail and analysis provided\\n         * The potential severity level for the information shared\\n         * The types of applications, operating systems, and other\\n           software and hardware potentially affected\\n         * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\\n         * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE\\n\\nQ. Who should contribute to the VCP?\\nA. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other\\nentity.\\n\\nQ. Why are you launching this program?\\nA.

The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and\\noutput) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly\\ndesigned systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for\\nCSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break\\nwith exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)\\nbecause of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export\\nrules at the time.\\n\\nEven more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing\\nplayer break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They\\nrapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm\\nwith an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks\\nmight have further reduced the strength).

The problem is that \"--with  --without \" is clearly not meant to change deeply the way a package is built.

By integrating the advanced\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\\n\\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\\n\\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\\n  essential.\\n\\n  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\\n  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be\\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\\n\\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\\n  \"present.\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\\n  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\\n\\n  \"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\" says\\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. \"The powerful combination\\n  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist\\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\"\\n\\n  \"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\\n  training, support and product design,\" says David Farrington, vice president\\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \"By integrating the\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\"\\n\\n  About Magi\\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\\n  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\\n  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can\\n  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and\\n  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work\\n  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming\\n  unsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent\\n  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as\\n  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical\\n  interface, and universal name spaces generating \"follow me URLs\" for mobile\\n  professionals.\\n\\n  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.\\n  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing\\n  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,\\n  [URL]www.tadpole.com[/URL], which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad\\n  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

Last week, search requests\\nfor information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on\\nproducts and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space,\\nmany credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than\\nmusic, according to Wired News.  \\n---|---  \\n**2** | **Macworld:**  \\nThe annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not\\nSteve Jobs has anything real to announce. So far, it looks like Apple has\\nalready surprised a few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No.\\n7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire.  \\n**3** | **PayPal:**  \\nIt's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and PayPal deal. Soon after eBay\\nannounced it was buying PayPal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit\\nclaiming that PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being\\nsubpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its involvement with\\nonline gambling transactions.  \\n**4** | **Wi-Fi:**  \\nI'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the Buzz Meter\\npermanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact\\nbetween tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon\\nCommunications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public\\nareas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports.  \\n**5** | **eMac:**  \\nThis is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that\\nApple released it to them. The CNET review is out, and here's the word: the\\neMac is what the iMac used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly\\ninexpensive computer for users who don't need to do much besides word\\nprocessing and accessing the Web.  \\nFor more Buzz, click here.  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage my subscriptions  | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

After all, while Microsoft is a giant software powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN 8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up with AOL? It just might.

One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this\\nbothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature\\ncameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But\\nwhat does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my\\nprivacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this\\ninteresting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing\\nthese miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them.\\nSo if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about\\nthis, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting\\ncaught on camera in an embarrassing situation.  \\n  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\nLee Koo  \\nCNET Community  \\nGot suggestions?
