Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate \\nwhen you'd like to do some changes to it. Gets messier when you'd have a \\nboot image on a server, and the only way you can test it is to boot it over \\nthe network. In any case, it's just one option available.\\n\\n>  AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking\\n>like it would just be on workstations from day one.

I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being \\nable to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need \\nto set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom \\ntakes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that \\nallows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all \\ndepending on what you want to do, I suppose.

[ALSA stuff] [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        I wish I could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff hooked up :( so I so not know about it. I have an excellent ESS Maestro3 which OSS supports pretty lame so I was forced to learn about ALSA. I have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip: arecord -l   (list devices) arecord -L   (list PCM decices) I get some output like this: > arecord -l card 0: MAESTRO3 [ESS Allegro PCI], device 0: Allegro [Allegro]   Subdevices: 1/1   Subdevice #0: subdevice #0 > arecord -L PCM list:  (SNIP - craploads of output) I noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or gamix have. For what it is worth, here is what I have in modules.conf for my sound stuff: > ## ALSA portion > alias char-major-116 snd > ## OSS/Free portion > alias char-major-14 soundcore > > ## ALSA portion > alias snd-card-0 snd-maestro3 > ## OSS/Free portion > alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0 > > ## OSS/Free portion - card #1 > alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss > # BAD alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss > alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss > # BAD alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss > alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss > # > ## ALSA Options (optional) > options snd snd_major=116 snd_cards_limit=1 snd_device_mode=0666 > options snd-maestro3 snd_index=0 snd_id=MAESTRO3 snd_amp_gpio=8 > # > ## OSS Options (optional) > alias snd-card-1 off > alias snd-card-2 off > alias snd-card-3 off > alias sound-slot-1 off > alias sound-service-1-0 off > > ## Preserve Mixer Settings > #post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore MAESTRO3 > #pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store MAESTRO3 > post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore > pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store Hope that helps, good luck.

Simply backup your /home, /etc >(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll >probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) > I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way. Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data? Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a space computer with a large HD with much free space). These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that used CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf. I do not want to re-rip all this crap again. -- That's \"angle\" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to just doing \tSeq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all). (That can be done via \"busy\") Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has nothing at all to do with \"pick\" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it is known in app-defaults files for the \"Catch Up Unseen\" menu item, but its implementation could certainly be fixed). kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Welcome back to  cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the self-pity can't get much worse. The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. \"3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87,\" read the Denver Post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" does spring to mind.  So does the phrase \"gloom and doom.\" \"Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States,\" said the San Jose Mercury News. \"Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again,\" wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines \"demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint  a bottom\" and \"disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history  has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond.\"  OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more. The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement \"Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market.\" And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, \"This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse.\" Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that \"the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty.\"  We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take  a while. The \"bottom\" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer No Happy Endings in September  [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL] Bear drags stocks deeply into den [URL]http://www.usatoday.com[/URL] Market's September is worst since 1937  [URL]http://www.nydailynews.com[/URL] Dow posts worst month in 4 years [URL]http://www.msnbc.com[/URL] Market's Worst Quarter Since '87 Crash Limps to a Close [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL] For Dow and S&P, Worst Quarter Since '87  [URL]http://www.washingtonpost.com[/URL] 3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87 (Denver Post) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] Market's tumble persists, capping worst three months in 15 years [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL] Stock Market Quarterly Review [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,2_0861,00.html (Paid subscription required.)

It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify. Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, \"If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath.\" The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- \"without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,\" quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter. One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's  time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing  details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. \"Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,\" the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May 2001. Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson Global Crossing: What Did Winnick Know?

Welcome back to cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the self-pity can't get much worse. The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. \"3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87,\" read the Denver Post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" does spring to mind.  So does the phrase \"gloom and doom.\" \"Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States,\" said the San Jose Mercury News. \"Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again,\" wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines \"demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom\" and \"disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond.\"  OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more. The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement \"Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market.\" And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, \"This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse.\" Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that \"the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty.\"  We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The \"bottom\" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer No Happy Endings in September  [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL]  Bear drags stocks deeply into den [URL]http://www.usatoday.com[/URL]  Market's September is worst since 1937  [URL]http://www.nydailynews.com[/URL]  Dow posts worst month in 4 years [URL]http://www.msnbc.com[/URL]  Market's Worst Quarter Since '87 Crash Limps to a Close [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]  For Dow and S&P, Worst Quarter Since '87  [URL]http://www.washingtonpost.com[/URL]  3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87 (Denver Post) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  Market's tumble persists, capping worst three months in 15 years [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL]  Stock Market Quarterly Review [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,2_0861,00.html  (Paid subscription required.)

It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify. Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, \"If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath.\" The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- \"without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,\" quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter. One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. \"Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,\" the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May 2001. Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson Global Crossing: What Did Winnick Know?
