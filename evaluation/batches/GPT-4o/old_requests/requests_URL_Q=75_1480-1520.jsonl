There's a lot of evidence that \\nadvertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a \\nproduct to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where \\nconsumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. \\n\\nThere is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first \\nrose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our \\nimmunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium \\nto lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. \\nAnd once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead \\nof advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://jrobb.userland.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.amazon.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.\\n\\nBuffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like \\nGTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply \\nwarning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is \\na belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of \\nprimetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should \\nair during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to \\nrestrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The \\nshows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and \\nsome aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents \\nand children wish to watch TV together during this hour.\\n\\nIt should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television \\nviewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then \\ndon't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or \\nshoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because \\nyou don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let \\nyour kids watch it.\\n\\nThe PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example \\nof one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show \\ninappropriate for kids.

I have to \\nadmit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, \"Do you \\nreally agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!\"\\n\\nDo I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of \\ncourse not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in \\nmind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily \\nagreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas \\nregarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is \\nan issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.\\n\\nTo cover the list specifically:\\n\\n\\n- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's \\nproposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is \\npainfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in \\norder for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.\\n\\n- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the \\nuseless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain \\nspeed.\\n\\n- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield \\nwidget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, \\nslow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's \\ntop usability problem.\\n\\n- Message display - Yes. No argument here.\\n\\n- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's \\na mess.\\n\\n- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be \\nseparated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with \\nmultiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., \\nyou can eliminate the New submenu easily).\\n\\n- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.\\n\\n- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS \\ndefault on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. \\nIf you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla \\nusability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. \\n(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 \\nwants to fire it.)\\n\\n- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is \\ncompletely irrelevant.\\n\\n- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a \\ntangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique \\ndialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly \\nhalf the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously \\noverconfigurable.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.blakeross.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://mpt.phrasewise.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This \\nexcerpt was rather amusing.\\n\\n_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better \\nbrowser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed \\nbrowsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser \\nwindow, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in \\nMozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called \\nMultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, \\nYecies, of Netscape, said, \"That's true, but the engineer who's working on it \\n[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of \\nfostering general browsing usability for Netscape.\" \\n_\\nYes, ok, I suppose that's true if by \"Netscape employee\" you really meant \\n\"Apple employee.\" and by \"always done with the intention of fostering general \\nbrowsing usability for Netscape\" you meant \"was done in a weekend for Mozilla \\nbecause I thought MultiZilla was cool.\" \\n\\nHere's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally \\ndownloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I \\nwas particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed \\nbrowsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed \\nbrowser that embedded WinIE. \\n\\nMultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that \\nprevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was \\na UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last \\ncontext menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been \\ndefinite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure \\ncapabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that \\nthe tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. \\n\\nI produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a \\nweekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that \\nencapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files \\nwould be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the \\nsingle tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.\\n\\nThe response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So \\nmuch so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was \\noverruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) \\nEven with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed \\nbrowsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still \\ndidn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that \\nnobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They \\ncontinued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity \\nthat one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make \\nof it.\\n\\nOnly after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure \\nNetscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it \\nnow? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and \\ntwenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. \\n\\nCan you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say \"you \\nshould do this\" or \"you should do that\", they get completely ignored (or blown \\noff), but when CNet says \"We didn't like this, or we didn't like that.\", \\nNetscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://archive.salon.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.salon.com[/URL]\\n[3] [URL]http://www.mozdev.org[/URL]\\n[4] [URL]http://www.netcaptor.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It's a pretty basic \\nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \\nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \\nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \\nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance \\npolicy for regressions.\\n\\nWhile this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \\nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \\nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \\nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \\nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \\nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \\nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!\\n\\nYou can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \\nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \\nrule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 \\npeople.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \\npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \\nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \\ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \\nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \\nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla \\nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \\nhe'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. \\nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \\nto the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He \\ndoesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \\neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.\\n\\nWe need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \\nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \\nfeatures that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in \\nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \\nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \\ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \\nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?\\n-  link what?\\n\\n\\n\\n- The sidebar is \\n\\n\\n- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution \\n- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have \\nsplitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML \\npanels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... \\n- a waste of real estate\\n\\n\\n\\n- Form auto-fill \\n\\n\\n- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information \\nfirst \\n- should just happen automatically\\n\\n\\n\\n- Downloads \\n\\n\\n- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! \\n- should be clearly visible and understandable.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Toolbars should \\n\\n\\n- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the \\nwindow, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be \\nable to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be \\nable to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and \\ncontext menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file \\nsystem and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and \\nmow my lawn and... \\n- be customizable within reason\\n\\n\\n\\n- Composer should \\n\\n\\n- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. \\nEverywhere! \\n- not be part of a Web browser.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Mail should \\n\\n\\n- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a \\ndifference? \\n- be a separate application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, \\nyou can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to \\nthe \"optional add-on\" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or \\nmouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them \\nyourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will \\nfacilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an \\nalarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should \\nautomatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nA layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become \\nas complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The \\ngeek features aren't inflicted on you by default.\\n\\nFinally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an \\nopportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the \\nbrowser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the \\nuser interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions \\nwithin Netscape.\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.mozillanews.org[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.mozillazine.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal  charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into  AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting \"Glengarry Glen Ross.\" Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is \"round tripping,\" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, \"thus allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,\" explained the Wall Street Journal. Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush  administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with \"a major media company.\" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.   The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.  So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that  make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but  that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. -  Jen Muehlbauer Homestore Executives Agree to Guilty Pleas  [URL]http://www.washingtonpost.com[/URL] Homestore, AOL Ad Deals Yield Guilty Pleas (USA Today) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] U.S. Focuses on Executive at Homestore [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL] Homestore's Ex-Execs to Aid Investigators [URL]http://www.latimes.com[/URL],0,5107257.story Probe of Homestore Turns To an Ex-AOL Executive [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1032971619118707713,00.html (Paid registration required.)

The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified Jean-Marie Messier. Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24  paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.   The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still  had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update \"more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.\" There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu,  an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake  in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone conference.  The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. \"He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,\" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, \"This all went to his  head.\"  With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt?

I haven't seen what you describe, but I just saw something close to what you  describe.

That was pretty good. My heart \\nwas racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive \\nultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head \\nwith blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not \\ndiseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general \\nartery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they \\nwere sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the \\nheart). \\n\\nNow there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very \\nwell. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I \\nasked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does \\nit mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really \\nnot much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the \\nones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an \\nangiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass \\nbecause of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part \\nof my heart not working, but what can you do about it?\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.vascularweb.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
