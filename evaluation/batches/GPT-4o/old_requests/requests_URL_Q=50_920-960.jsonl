I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get\\nthat detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is\\nnot supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than\\nenough for 1 PC ).\\n\\nIt could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more\\ndifficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!!

Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths  A reporter came by the Lindows.com   offices last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use  LindowsOS to write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.   I turned on the Walmart.com  computer and then clicked on the running man   which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse   where I installed OpenOffice   using Click-N-Run. I then clicked the \"Run It\"  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer. I then typed \"Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save hundreds using LindowsOS.\" I selected \"Save as Microsoft Word.\" The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters, he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to overcome a couple of myths.  The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5 minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at  .   The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist. Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these products is via the Click-N-Run   Warehouse.  Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in the Warehouse  all downloaded and installed with a single click: OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and swap them with Microsoft counterparts.  Programs included are: OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs)  OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel)  OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint) OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program Click here   for a great tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice. GIMP  If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop, you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor.    Evolution  For those used to Microsoft's Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check out how easy it is to use  . Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit Flowchart Pro at  This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the Warehouse  that make Linux a practical choice for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the math.   For  a total cost of $499  , including all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete system.  With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars stretched much further running LindowsOS.  Michael Robertson Please visit   to answers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!  LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a \"Friendly-Install\" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of \"bridge\" Windows-compatible programs.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Forwarded-by: William Knowles  [URL]http://www.thesun.co.uk[/URL],,2-2002430339,00.html By PAUL CROSBIE Sep 16, 2002 VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club. The 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies. But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk. Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago. It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who launched it in July. Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table. At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem. The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby. One Airbus worker said: \"We couldn't work it out. Then the penny dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It caused great amusement.\" The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200. A Virgin spokeswoman said: \"Those determined to join the Mile High Club will do so despite the lack of comforts. \"We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something that we would encourage because of air regulations.\" The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan \"Mine is bigger than yours\". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far East and the US.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
