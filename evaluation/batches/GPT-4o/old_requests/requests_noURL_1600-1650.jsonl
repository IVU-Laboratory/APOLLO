There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT  listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in  dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly  hoping to contact girls, appearing in \"alt.teens\" and similar groups -  I just tried a Google Groups search on \"Robert Moaby\" and some of  them came top of the list. Note for Marie - \"MT\" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK  version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.  Rob ------------------------ Yahoo!

In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W.

In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\\nthe 2000 Presidential election.

Bronson -\\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\\n muscle power. \\n \\n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\\n virtually no cost. \\n \\n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\\n exercise industry. \\n \\n \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"Its a joke and a big con and they call\\n me a criminal!\" You cant help feeling he has a point. \\n \\n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. \\n \\n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to\\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\\n murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\\n award-winning film. \\n \\n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\\n a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\\n critical praise. \\n \\n And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt\\n scribbling away as we speak. \\n \\n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books\\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\\n pragmatic and profound. \\n \\n He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \\n \\n \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \\n \\n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\\n \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\\n the very essence of who they are. \\n \\n \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\\n good?\" \\n \\n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\\n two days during a jail siege. \\n \\n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \\n \\n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every\\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \\n \\n \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of\\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\\n described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\\n its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\\n your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me.\" \\n \\n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\\n we all needed. \\n \\n \\n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\\n be available in bookstores from October at 7.99\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

At shopping \\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \\nask for our votes.\\n\\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\\n\\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\\n\\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\\n\\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \\nthrough any of those channels.\\n\\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\\n\\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\\n\\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\\n\\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\\n\\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\\n\\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \\ngroups.\\n\\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \\nadvocacy management and communications software company.

Consider it on my list of things to check. Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't  support the icon window. However, I did fix some bugs in the related \"Hide When Empty\" functionality  which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove \"unseen\" from the \"always  show sequences\" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in  the help window for \"Icon Window\" as it already is for \"Hide When Empty\".

It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.   I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the  documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file. I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new  functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much  everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much  done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and  hopefully do nothing more afterwards.
