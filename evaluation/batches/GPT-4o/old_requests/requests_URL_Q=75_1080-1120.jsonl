Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released  version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they  sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your  own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means \"so much has been  changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release  anyway\".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this  from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y. If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;) Thomas  --  The Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - [URL]http://davedina.apestaart.org[/URL] <-*-                      -*-> And every time she sneezes I think it's love and oh lord I'm not ready for this sort of thing <-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*-> URGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - [URL]http://urgent.rug.ac.be[/URL] _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Then again, perhaps the particular font I'm using just has bad bytecodes.  That font is \"QuickType II\", grabbed off my Windows partition, where it was installed by I-have-no-idea-which-application. Anybody else experimenting with bytecode-enabled freetype, presumably with different fonts?  Do you find the same bad antialiased rendering that I found, or do other fonts work well? _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me.    Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a  sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked,  well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with  and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below.  The first, \"no-bytecodes.png\",  shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode  interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, \"bytecodes.png\", taken with  the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several  rendering anomalies appear:    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in \"R\" and \"o\".    - The left side of the \"Q\" is painted in too light a shade of grey,      causing it to drop out somewhat.  \"C\", not in this sample, has the      same problem.    - \"Qu\" are set right up against each other, with insufficient      whitespace between them.    - \"M\" is distinctly asymmetric.    - The enclosed loop of \"a\" looks muddy, as it is partially filled      with grey.  Contrast with \"a\" drawn without the bytecode      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off.  It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of  making a mess of antialiased rendering. This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part,  I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode  interpreter turned *off*. --Boundary_(ID_xjiotMI3LbV/zJ0Zs39NiA) Content-type: image/png;

The two men pioneered the construction of giant\\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\\nthe sun by the billion.\\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because\\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\\nIn fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and\\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\\nsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.\\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba\\nalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach\\nDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.\\nThis year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney\\nBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,\\n55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the\\nKarolinska Institute.\\nThe researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ\\ngrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how\\nviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as\\nAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.\\nThe winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday\\nmorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of\\nAlfred Nobel later the same day.\\nThe literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish\\nAcademy said on Tuesday.\\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -\\nwill be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\\nThe award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are\\nnot publicly revealed for 50 years.\\nAlfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who\\nendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.\\nIn his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to\\nthose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and\\n``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field\\nof physics.''\\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and\\neconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts\\nin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted\\nin strict secrecy.\\nThe prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in\\n1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.\\n---\\nOn the Net:\\nNobel site, [URL]http://www.nobel.se[/URL] \\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It's very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they're here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\\nfact.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The new\\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\\nchurch.\\nNevertheless, the society said: \"It is clear that he prefers his private\\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\\n\"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\\ndown,\" it said.\\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an \"action plan,\" including calling on\\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\\nDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\\n\"taking steps towards appropriate direct action\".\\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\\nsociety's chairman, said: \"Watch this space.\" Presumably it could involve a\\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\\nis present.\\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\\nevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\\nA letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the\\nevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\\nteaching.\\nOn the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption\\nand blackmail. \"It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,\" she said.\\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. \"Matters of sexuality\\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.\"\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to  see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this  isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one  day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew  Iraq would be in here somewhere). \"Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,\" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official \"said that only a portion  of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.\" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, \"Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,\" said the San Francisco  Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the  economy. \"Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,\" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas.

[URL]http://www.technologyinsider.com[/URL]  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP ----------------------------------------------------------------- wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry \"fowl.\"  We mean \"foul.\" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite  service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics --  it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as  some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified \"major revisions\" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted  to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the  cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, \"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns.\" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch  waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB103403314258094560,00.html (Paid subscription required) Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchase [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1033939901346228393,00.html (Paid subscription required) 'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] EchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hope [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL] F.C.C.

Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified \"major revisions\" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, \"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns.\" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB103403314258094560,00.html  (Paid subscription required) Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchase [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1033939901346228393,00.html  (Paid subscription required) 'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  EchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hope [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL]  F.C.C.
