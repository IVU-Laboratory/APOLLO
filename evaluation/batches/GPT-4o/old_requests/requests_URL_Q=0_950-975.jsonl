Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths  A reporter came by the Lindows.com   offices last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use  LindowsOS to write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.   I turned on the Walmart.com  computer and then clicked on the running man   which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse   where I installed OpenOffice   using Click-N-Run. I then clicked the \"Run It\"  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer. I then typed \"Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save hundreds using LindowsOS.\" I selected \"Save as Microsoft Word.\" The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters, he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to overcome a couple of myths.  The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5 minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at  .   The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist. Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these products is via the Click-N-Run   Warehouse.  Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in the Warehouse  all downloaded and installed with a single click: OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and swap them with Microsoft counterparts.  Programs included are: OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs)  OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel)  OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint) OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program Click here   for a great tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice. GIMP  If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop, you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor.    Evolution  For those used to Microsoft's Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check out how easy it is to use  . Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit Flowchart Pro at  This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the Warehouse  that make Linux a practical choice for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the math.   For  a total cost of $499  , including all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete system.  With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars stretched much further running LindowsOS.  Michael Robertson Please visit   to answers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!  LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a \"Friendly-Install\" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of \"bridge\" Windows-compatible programs.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Forwarded-by: William Knowles  [URL]http://www.thesun.co.uk[/URL],,2-2002430339,00.html By PAUL CROSBIE Sep 16, 2002 VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club. The 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies. But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk. Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago. It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who launched it in July. Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table. At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem. The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby. One Airbus worker said: \"We couldn't work it out. Then the penny dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It caused great amusement.\" The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200. A Virgin spokeswoman said: \"Those determined to join the Mile High Club will do so despite the lack of comforts. \"We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something that we would encourage because of air regulations.\" The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan \"Mine is bigger than yours\". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far East and the US.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This strategic\\npartnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security\\nprotocol used by every e-based\\ndesktop, laptop and server. \\n\\nUnder the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors\\nTechnology's award-winning Magi\\nEnterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and\\nencryption to every\\nMagi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow\\nbetween workgroups within and\\nbeyond the enterprise.\\n\\nSecure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly\\nnetwork infrastructures. This\\ncombination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific\\nsecurity tools for each desktop\\napplication such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration\\ncan now be rapidly, easily and\\nsecurely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,\\npartners and clients without concern\\nin compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact\\nhighly securely with strong\\nencryption and authentication across firewalls.\\n\\n\"In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,\" says\\nBernard Hulme, chairman and\\nCEO of Endeavors Technology. \"Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT\\nmanagers with added\\nassurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric\\npeer-to-peer computing\"\\n\\nEndeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete\\ninteroperability between\\npartner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA\\nClearTrust Web access\\nmanagement, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.\\n\\nThe strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging\\nand advertising, be listed in\\nRSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.\\nIt will also lead to joint\\nmarketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on\\njoint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide\\nbusiness continuity support.\\n\\n\"Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise\\nproducts and streamlining the\\ndeployment process for IT managers,\" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. \"By\\ncombining our products,\\nenterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.\"\\n\\nAbout Magi\\nMagi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure\\ninter- and intra-enterprise\\ncollaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for\\ncollaboration very rapidly and\\naffordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this\\nby effectively transforming\\nunsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through\\nthe use of such features as\\ncross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name\\nspaces generating \"follow me URLs\"\\nfor mobile professionals.\\n\\nAbout RSA Security, Inc.\\nRSA Security Inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations\\nfor e-business through its RSA\\nSecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon\\ndigital certificate\\nmanagement product families. With approximately one billion RSA BSAFE-enabled applications in use worldwide,\\nmore than ten million RSA\\nSecurID authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, RSA Security has the proven\\nleadership and innovative technology to\\naddress the changing security needs of e-business and bring trust to the online economy.

It occurs at the very end of an excellent article which I recommend to you. In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been listening to an heroic sermon about \"the glory to be won in battle by young patriots armed with the love of God.\" He usurps the pulpit and prays the following: \"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\" Twain wrote the story, \"The War Prayer,\" in 1905 during the American occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it \"unsuitable\" for publication at the time it was written. #  distributed via : no commercial use without permission #   is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, #  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets #  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and \"info nettime-l\" in the msg body #  archive: [URL]http://www.nettime.org[/URL] contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net --- end forwarded text --  ----------------- R.

But what this graphic editor will do is make quick    work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--    and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.    Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which    you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you    group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful    cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for    some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,    antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

Find your IT\\ntalent solution today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nYou're a good bunch, you Penguins.\\n\\nToday's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you\\na quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik\\nhas found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With\\nDiabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,\\nwith the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost\\nirrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively\\noffered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work\\nfor the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to\\neffect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little\\ncallous about the 'Net ...\\n\\nAccordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing\\npart of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can\\nfurther put our technical skills (be they Linux _or_ Windows skills) to work\\nfor a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort,\\nbased in the Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services\\nto worthwhile charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly\\ndescribes our purpose. Next, we need volunteers with the time and ability to\\nlend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to\\nthe charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe\\nthe organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain can\\nuse some hands-on or remote volunteer help.\\n\\nI'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the\\nAicardi Syndrome Foundation. Though I don't currently know their technical\\nneeds, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read \"research and technical\\ndollars are minimal.\" I'm sure we can, as a group, provide them a way to fill\\nexisting technical holes.\\n\\nThat's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make\\nothers.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging\\nprogram, GeekLog to pull together a community project area where interested\\nparties can gather, coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become.\\nI'll keep you posted on the details.\\n\\nIn one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor\\nPenguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their\\nprotection from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into\\nthe water, all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nWhere could the analogy possibly be more fitting?\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in\\nshortcuts you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to\\nchange your system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips\\nthat are quick and very easy to learn and remember.\\n\\nGot a cluttered console screen? Use **[ctrl]+l** to clear it. This does the\\nsame thing as the **clear** command with far fewer keystrokes.\\n\\nDo you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the **[ctrl+d** key\\ncombination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the\\ncurrent user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal\\nwindow, as well.\\n\\nTo me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can\\navoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then\\nI've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings\\nusing these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's\\nsubstantial.\\n\\nMaximum efficiency.

Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss\\nconfiguring block devices in your kernel.\\n\\nWe've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell\\nissues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and\\ncharacter devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.\\nBlock devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of\\ndata \"blocks.\" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of\\ndata to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly.\\nData intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your\\npower dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating\\ndata up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.\\n\\nCharacter devices, on the other hand, receive data in \"streams,\" one character\\nat a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle\\ndata input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer _then_\\ncommitting the data.\\n\\nThe physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining\\nwhy they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to\\nstore or retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of\\nthe disc surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know\\nwhere there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the\\ndisc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related\\ndata together.\\n\\nCharacter devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and\\nforget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and\\nphysical. The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm\\nPilot. The storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a\\nphysical storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive\\nand account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also\\nsend a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an\\nindication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as\\nwell.\\n\\nSo, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the\\nsystem for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a\\npredetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical\\nproperties of the hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest\\nlevel view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical\\ndata storage really is.\\n\\nIn the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data\\nstorage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about\\nyour existing hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you\\nusing? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the\\ndrive located - on the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because\\nthe variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock\\nconfiguration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. I can\\ntell you this - you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a\\nfloppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can.\\nFind out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the\\nconfiguration process will be relatively painless.\\n\\nA warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series\\ncontinues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration\\nrecommendations where possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make\\nsuch recommendations. However, where the variable set is as broad as block\\ndevices, much of the legwork will be up to you.\\n\\nTomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**rxLinux**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.fusionw3.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of\\nmultiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web\\ninterface is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers.\\nServers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the\\nconfiguration and software from a master server. No administration is done\\ndirectly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers.

I'm sure you do - but where did it come\\nfrom? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did\\nMicrosoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?\"\\n\\nHistory of LDAP\\n\\n[URL]http://www.microsoft.com[/URL]\\n\\nX.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a comprehensive Directory Service,\\nincluding an information model, namespace, functional model, and\\nauthentication framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol\\n(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full OSI protocol that\\ncontains extensive functionality, much of which is not used by most\\napplications.\\n\\nDAP is significantly more complicated than the more prevalent TCP/IP stack\\nimplementations and requires more code and computing horsepower to run. The\\nsize and complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, such as\\nthe PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality often comes with the machine.\\nDAP stack implementations are cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the\\nacceptance of X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, with\\nhelp from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed a protocol that would\\nwork over TCP/IP and was small enough when implemented to run on a thin client\\nlike PC's running the Windows operating system or the Macintosh.\\n\\nThe LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March of 1994. The LDAP\\nversion 2 Specification was published as rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and\\nIndexing of Directories (ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In\\nApril of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and Novell\\nseparately announced support for LDAP protocol in their Directory Services\\nproducts in order that they may in turn operate with each other and integrate\\nwith the Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts but at\\nthis time is not finished.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSYSTEM  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Looking for Sound**  \\nSuggested by Corey Hollett\\n\\n[URL]http://www.turtlebeach.com[/URL]  \\n[URL]http://www.3dsoundsurge.com[/URL]\\n\\n_\"I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best sound card and speaker set\\ncombination for 5.1 sound. My criteria were that it be excellent for games,\\nmusic, and dvd playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong point.\"_\\n\\nCorey came to the same conclusion that others have in two respects. Creative\\nhas long maintained a healthy share of the sound card market with a solid name\\nand decent products. Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle\\nBeach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards and at attractive\\nprice points. Corey decided on the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card, a great\\nchoice.\\n\\nHis choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings on the subject. I own\\ntwo Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 2.400 and most recently the ProMedia\\n5.1. The 2.400 system was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me\\nwhen I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the dust. The above\\nreview that Corey pointed out hits the high points, and is actually quite in-\\ndepth for an \"initial\" review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write\\nup a more complete version, as mentioned in the article.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeALERTZ  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Today's Top 5 kbAlertz**\\n\\n  * Q269272 - Mail Client Address List Truncated Using \"Mailto:\" Link If Tag Exceeds 260 Characters (Q269272)\\n  * Q313043 - FIX: Creation of Local Cube Fails (Q313043)\\n  * Q320273 - Subfolders of a Web Folder Are Not Enumerated in the Folders Pane in Windows XP (Q320273)\\n  * Q241210 - Drive List Shows Only Program Drive in 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs (Q241210)\\n  * Q241189 - SNMP Memory Leak in Windows NT4.0 Peer-to-Peer Network (Q241189)\\n\\n**GET HIGH-SPEED ACCESS:** Verizon Online DSL is an affordable, high-speed\\nInternet connection.

MPEG-4\\nisn't the only addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite\\namong professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 5 support and\\nbetter AppleScript functionality also tag along. As always, there is a\\nstandard free version available for download, but the Pro edition adds\\nadditional features, such as full screen video playback, the ability to create\\nMPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free player.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSTUFF  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Microtel & WalMart Love Linux**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.theregister.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nWalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. They were one of the\\nfirst manufacturers to preinstall LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail\\nmarket through WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-\\ninstalled choice in operating systems. These options give potential Linux\\nusers an easier way to get started without having to build their own system\\nfrom scratch or deal with driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall\\ncost. A Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little as $648\\nwith Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.
