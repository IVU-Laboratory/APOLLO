I am sorry this mail\\nWill surprise you, though we do not know, \\nDue to the current war against white farmers in\\nZimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to\\nClaim all white owned farms in our country to gain\\nFavor for re-election.\\n\\nAll white farmers were asked to\\nSurrender their farms to the government for\\nRe-distribution and infact to his political party\\nMembers and my father though black was the treasury\\nof the farmers association and a strong member of an\\nOpposition party that did not support the president\\nIdea. He then ordered his party members and the police\\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will \\nDocuments has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit\\nKept in custody for us in a security company unknown\\nTo the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as \\nPersonal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could\\nEasily be found by his enemies. The total amount is\\nUS$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for\\nYour assistance to help us move the fund out of\\nZimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from\\nreality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of\\nInternational Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the \\nFinance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer\\nClearance above US$1M is just a few of the\\nUnthinkable things he is committing in my Country.\\nI have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.\\nJohn Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was\\nLeaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family\\nLate last year following this ugly development to no\\nAvail.\\nShould you be interested to help us, contact me\\nImmediately via email for easy communication and I\\nWill furnish you with the time frame and modalities of\\nthe transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of \\nCaring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that \\nThis transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will \\nNot endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%\\nOf the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any\\nAccount of your choice were the incident of taxation\\nwill not take much tool on the money and we look\\nForward to coming over to your country to invest our\\nShare and settle there.

JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign\\nremittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned \\nsum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with \\naccount number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who \\ndied along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska \\nAirlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read \\nmore about the crash on visiting this site \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great \\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery \\nthat I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank \\nto release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will \\nsend to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \\nsubsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this \\nmoney to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained \\nunclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years \\nand I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered \\nto our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know \\nthat the money is not transfered into our treasure.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by \\nthe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinab cannot stand as \\nnext of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering \\nyou 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other \\ncharges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the \\nremaining 65% is for me.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of \\nthe application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for \\nthis money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free \\nand that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have \\nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \\nreceive this mail through the above email.\\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY  YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT \\nREQUEST.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\nDR.
