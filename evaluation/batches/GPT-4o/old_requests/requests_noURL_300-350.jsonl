The first beta of Vipul's > Razor v2 is now available for public download. 1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta. 2)  When you go to the \"Download\" page, it tells you \"Fetch the latest versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages\"  It is not at all clear that these are development packages. The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the word \"beta\" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design \"fact\": USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*) I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test sites. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. rOD. -- Anyway... long story short... ...is a phrase whose origins are complicated and rambling. >> Doing the blogging thang again at [URL]http://www.groovymother.com[/URL] << ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

The callers are then  changed to pass what the function > expects.  In the case of Msg_Change, the  'line' argument is removed > and we only have the msgid argument.  Ftoc_ClearCurrent is now the > first line of MsgChange.  The following patch removes Ftoc_RescanLine in favour of a  Ftoc_RescanLines. It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc  accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it. It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of  falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an  effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence. It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on  folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does  not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic  scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now  corresponds better to what's on disk. Comments appreciated. I'm going to be offlike for a couple of days,  so I send the cvs diff rather than putting it in the cvs. /Anders --==_Exmh_6514812010 Content-Type: application/x-patch ; name=\"exmh.patch\" Content-Description: exmh.patch Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"exmh.patch\" Index: lib/ftoc.tcl =================================================================== RCS file: /cvsroot/exmh/exmh/lib/ftoc.tcl,v retrieving revision 1.29 diff -u -b -B -w -p -r1.29 ftoc.tcl --- lib/ftoc.tcl\t22 Jul 2002 21:46:35 -0000\t1.29 +++ lib/ftoc.tcl\t24 Jul 2002 09:16:25 -0000 @@ -558,7 +558,7 @@ proc FtocPickRange { {addcurrent 0} } {  \tif {$addcurrent} {  \t    Ftoc_RangeHighlight $ftoc(curLine) $ftoc(curLine)  \t} -\tFtoc_ClearCurrent +\tFtoc_ClearCurrent $ftoc(curLine)  \tMsg_ClearCurrent  \tset ftoc(curLine) {}      } @@ -611,31 +611,55 @@ proc Ftoc_NewFtoc {} {  # Ftoc_ClearCurrent and Ftoc_Change are two parts of  # dinking the ftoc display when advancing a message.   -proc Ftoc_ClearCurrent {} { -    # Clear display of current message +# +# Make line no longer appear as the currently selected line +# + +proc Ftoc_ClearCurrent { line } {      global ftoc exwin      set ftoc(pickone) 1      set ftoc(lineset) {}   -    if {$ftoc(curLine) == {}} { -\tset ftoc(curLine) [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)] -    } -    if {$ftoc(curLine) != {}} { -\t$exwin(ftext) tag remove cur $ftoc(curLine).0 $ftoc(curLine).end -\tFtoc_RescanLine $ftoc(curLine) -    } -    return $ftoc(curLine) -} -proc Ftoc_Change { line {show show} } { +#We dont need this any more since we work off the line  +#argument, not $ftoc(curLine) +#    if {$ftoc(curLine) == {}} { +#      set ftoc(curLine) [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)] +#    } +#    if {$ftoc(curLine) != {}} { +#      $exwin(ftext) tag remove cur $ftoc(curLine).0 $ftoc(curLine).end +#      Ftoc_RescanLine $ftoc(curLine) +#    } +     #should check that 0<$line => $f\" warn @@ -1113,7 +1192,7 @@ proc FtocCommit {tagname commitProc {cop  \t    set ftoc(displayDirty) 1  \t    Ftoc_ClearMsgCache  \t    if {$msgid == $curid} { -\t\tFtoc_ClearCurrent +\t\tFtoc_ClearCurrent $ftoc(curLine)  \t\tMsg_ClearCurrent  \t    }  \t    if {$L == $ftoc(curLine)} { Index: lib/msg.tcl =================================================================== RCS file: /cvsroot/exmh/exmh/lib/msg.tcl,v retrieving revision 1.21 diff -u -b -B -w -p -r1.21 msg.tcl --- lib/msg.tcl\t22 Jul 2002 21:23:48 -0000\t1.21 +++ lib/msg.tcl\t24 Jul 2002 09:16:26 -0000 @@ -73,10 +73,20 @@ proc Msg_ShowUnseen { {show show} } {      return 0  }  proc Msg_ClearCurrent { } { -    global msg exmh +    global msg exmh ftoc +    # Are there cases where this is not true? +    if {$ftoc(folder) == $exmh(folder)} {  +        set prevline [Ftoc_FindMsg [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)]] +        if {$prevline == {}} { +            unset prevline +        } +    }      set msg(id) {}\t\t;# Clear current message      set msg(dpy) {}\t\t;# and currently displayed message      Mh_ClearCur $exmh(folder) +    if {[info exists prevline]} { +        Ftoc_ClearCurrent $prevline +    }      MsgClear      Buttons_Current 0      Uri_ClearCurrent @@ -117,13 +127,13 @@ proc Msg_Change {msgid {show show} } {      Exmh_Debug Msg_Change [time [list MsgChange $msgid $show]]  }  proc MsgChange {msgid {show show}} { -    global exmh exwin msg mhProfile +    global exmh exwin msg mhProfile ftoc   -    Ftoc_ClearCurrent +    set prevline [Ftoc_FindMsg [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)]]      Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid      Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)      set line [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid] -    if {!

I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed >> (especially those with multiple email addresses...). > > What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain. > Ah the great spam debate wages on ... So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-) Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )   Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down. When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to my @hotmail account. I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more knowledgable.

And, anytime I speak\\nto someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to\\ncontact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be\\namazed at how confused many people get by them as well.

I never have, and I don't see any\\nreason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to\\nsend out viruses to people.

They're a pain.\\n\\nWell, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends\\ndo.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I\\nknow, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty\\nothers have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of\\nthem for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which\\nemail addresses are already approved and avoid using others.\\n\\nPlus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email\\naddress from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new\\njob info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to\\ntell them about your new job email address?\\n\\n -Mike\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one. Want to find out more about PGP? You can get the software from: PGPfreeware  GnuPG (GPG)  Bring the following:    *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)    *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key. Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

I installed it before I knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is \"gnome-core\" vs. \"gnome-session\" but I can not remember. Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except updated.

Certainly  Frequency of messages does _not_ let you draw valid conclusions about the understanding of the issues at hand of the sender.

This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules. That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort. But in his place I would have (hopefully :) reevaluated my arguments in the face of, as I saw it, massive rejection of his idea what constitutes spam. Maybe this list can return to discussing technical topics.
