If the sequence doesn't exist, it will be cleaned up then. Perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well, but this is effective enough. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Even then, those relics were well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.   Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.   Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.   It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.   The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store, runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away from the Microsoft monopoly. ...      - [URL]http://finance.lycos.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just  now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to  forward me a clue feel free. Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that  my sequences are ... cluttered. --Hal _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist in general taking 5-10 seconds.  Interesting that a different wish comes up fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4. > Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen > messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages > rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.
