Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of = Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of C= hina. _The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, = and present information that is highly in demand by the market._ = Apart from the core print and electr= onic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, su= ch as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and tr= aining in the field of wealth management and personal finance.=   These areas are closely linked to the cor= e competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands th= at they have built to further drive the growth potential. CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Repub= lic of China. **In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right = from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direc= t management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Develo= pment Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.** = **HIGHLIGHTS:** = May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Excl= usive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish= , Internationally. February 20= 02, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market r= esearch provider. March 2002, = CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique f= inancial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of Ch= ina. May 7, 2002, CXIN a= nnounces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket c= ompany and the _leading provider of emerging market securities_. May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had= hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President= , Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China M= orning Post and Asia Magazine. June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling = subscriptions. June 24, 2002, = CXIN announces the acquisition of  **Smart Investor Magazine** and= related business. _This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consol= idated revenues.  _ Jul= y 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, _one = of the worlds largest aggregators._  **INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:** According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, w= hich analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 yea= rs to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this i= ndustry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchan= dise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well position= ed to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing C= hinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted= by the Chinese government provide the company with an \"unfair advant= age\" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent licen= se agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the= world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will e= nable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Millio= n within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancin= g, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue a= nd profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares= do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sec= tor CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and abov= e this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.

I have decided to\\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be\\nvery beneficial to both\\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank,\\nmy department came\\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a\\ndeceased person Mr.Andreas\\nSchranner who who died with his wife and their only\\ndaughter on July 2000 in\\na plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his\\naccount with this Bank\\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either\\nfrom his family or\\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S $10.150M ((Ten million one\\nhundred and fiftythousand\\nUS dolloars)).

This is the\\nactual reason why it will\\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward\\nclaims as the next of kin\\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also\\npresent a foreign\\naccount where he will need the money to be\\nre-transferred into on his\\nrequest as it may be after due verification and\\nclarification by the\\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole\\nmoney will be remitted from\\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction\\nis 100% risk free.

On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.\\nAfter about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now.

It has defiled all forms of\\n medicine, and right now I have only about a few\\n months to live, according to medical experts.\\n\\n I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\\n never really cared for anyone not even myself but my\\n business. Though I am very rich, I was never\\n generous, I was always hostile to people and only\\n focus on my business as that was the only thing I\\ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know\\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\\n or make all the money in the world.\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come\\n to this world I would live my life a different way\\n from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called\\n me, I have willed and given most of my properties\\n and assets to my immediate and extended family\\n members and as well as a few close friends.\\n I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul\\n and so, I have decided to give alms to charity\\n organizations, as I want this to be one of the last\\n good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed\\n money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,\\n Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\\n deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any\\n more. I once asked members of my family to close one\\n of my accounts and distribute the money which I have\\n there to charity organization in Bulgaria and\\n Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to\\n themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as\\n they seem not to be contended with what I have left\\n for them.\\n The last of my money which no one knows of is the\\n huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars\\n that I have with a Bank in london.\\n I will want you to help me collect this deposit and\\ndispatched it to charity organizations.email me\\n at giversworld@fastermail.com\\n I have set aside 10% for you for your time and\\n patience.\\n\\nGod be with you.\\n\\n Saidi Fatou.\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\nGet free email address your_name@moldova.com at\\n[URL]http://www.moldova.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour Gateway to Moldova!\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\nSelect your own custom email address for FREE!

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane \\ncrash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \\nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \\nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release \\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety \\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want \\nthis money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \\nbusiness and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.\\n\\nThen after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \\naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \\ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \\nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \\nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \\neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application.\\n\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free \\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \\narrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me \\nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you \\nimmediately.
