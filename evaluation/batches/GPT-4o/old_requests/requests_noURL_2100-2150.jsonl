Sometimes  \\ncalling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  \\ntalking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  \\nto the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  \\n  \\nWe're here to help!  \\n  \\nWe'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  \\n  \\n**Period.**  \\n  \\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  \\n  \\nWe'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  \\n  \\n_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  \\n  \\n  \\n_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  \\n  \\n_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  \\n  \\n**\\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  \\nSeeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  \\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  \\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  \\n  \\n\\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  \\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  \\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  \\nmaking money from home.  If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!

Sometimes  \\ncalling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  \\ntalking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  \\nto the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  \\n  \\nWe're here to help!  \\n  \\nWe'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  \\n  \\n**Period.**  \\n  \\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  \\n  \\nWe'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  \\n  \\n_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  \\n  \\n  \\n_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  \\n  \\n_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  \\n  \\n**\\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  \\nSeeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  \\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  \\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  \\n  \\n\\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  \\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  \\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  \\nmaking money from home.  If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hi,\\n\\nI'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \\nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \\n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou've probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt's people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.\\n\\nIf you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt's that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \\nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes \\nis a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some \\nbasic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \\nDon't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step \\nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\\nbuild a booming online business.  You'll be generating \\norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.\\n\\nOkay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?\\n\\nNo problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot\\nproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay\\nstarting an Internet business because they have \\nnothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  \\nAfter reading the Spambook, you can build your complete \\nproduct line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE \\nnot to get started! I will get you up-and-running within \\nseven days.

This seperate guide contains a daily \\nroutine for you to follow with specific, exact \\ninstructions on how to get started.  On day one, for \\nexample, I teach you where to find a product to sell. \\nThe next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing \\nlist.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your \\nvery first campaign is ready to go.\\n\\nAs a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy \\nof our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk \\nemail program which retails for $49.99! I'll even\\ninclude 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE\\nif you order NOW!\\n\\nStop wasting your money on auction listing fees, \\nclassifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and \\nnever will!

Moreover, statistics show 45people\\nbecome millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.\\n\\nYou may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an\\nappearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he\\nwould do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.\\nWithout hesitating Trump said he would find a good network\\nmarketing company and get to work.\\nThe audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the\\naudience and dead-panned his response. \"That's why I'm sitting up\\nhere and you are all sitting out there!\"\\n\\nWith network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct\\ncommissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from\\nsales made by people you introduce to the business.\\n\\nResidual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing\\ntime and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.\\nIn network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of\\nothers.\\n\\nThe enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my\\nfingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave\\nsome thought and study to it.\\n\\nMy name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I\\nworked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position\\nwas eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to\\nopen my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many\\nunforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and\\ncreditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my\\nbusiness and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to\\nrefinance and borrow against my home to support my family and\\nstruggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened\\nin my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that\\nthis will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!\\n\\nIn mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's\\nprior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for\\ninformation on various business opportunities. All of the programs\\nI received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were\\neither too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial\\ninvestment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work\\nor not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one\\nyear. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!\\n\\nBut like I was saying, in December I received this program. I\\ndidn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a\\nmailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!\\nAfter reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it\\ncorrectly, I couldn't believe my eyes.\\n\\nHere was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.\\n\\nI could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me\\nfurther into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it\\nout, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I\\nwas still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal\\naspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office\\n(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed\\nlegal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN\\nLETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\"\\n\\nInitially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my\\ntime on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need\\nany money for printing to send out the program, and because all of\\nmy orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am\\ntelling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I\\npromised myself that I would not 'rip-off\" anyone, no matter how\\nmuch money it cost me.\\nHere is the basic version of what you need to do:\\n\\nYour first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1\\nwithin 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND\\nOUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.\\n\\nYour second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2\\nwithin 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.\\n\\nOnce you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You\\nwill make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,\\nkeep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.\\nKeep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.\\n\\nIn less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT\\n#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,\\n1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making\\n$50,000 in 90 days was done.\\n\\nBy January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more\\nthan I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my\\ne-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every\\nday. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.\\nPlease take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR\\nLIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This\\nprogram does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the\\nrules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It\\nwon't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!\\n\\nIn order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal\\nof 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you\\nwill make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first\\ntwo goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of\\nmoney, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out\\nthe programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF\\nTHAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,\\nI am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or\\nrisk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and\\nyou will be on your way to financial security.\\n\\nIf you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble\\nlike I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this\\na sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke\\n\\nP.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look\\nlike piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!\\n\\nA PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\\n\\nBy the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you\\nshould have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,\\ncould not have been created by an amateur.\\n\\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business\\nfor 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was\\ndoing the same things that were previously successful for me, but\\nit wasn't working.\\n\\nFinally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.\\nInflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had\\nbeen with us since 1945.\\n\\nI don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment\\nrate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There\\nwere more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.\\n\\nThe middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were\\ndoing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including\\nthose who never had anything to save or invest were moving down\\ninto the ranks of the poor.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.\"\\nThe traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to\\n\"move up\" or \"get rich\". Inflation will see to that.\\n\\nYou have just received information that can give you financial\\nfreedom for the rest of your life, with \"NO RISK\" and \"JUST A\\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.\" You can make more money in the next few\\nmonths than you have ever imagined.\\n\\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any\\nway. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a\\ncopy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of\\nthe people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name\\nwill be on everyone of them!\\n\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential\\ncustomers you will reach.\\n\\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO\\nYOU NOW!\\n\\n\"THINK ABOUT IT.\" Before you delete this program from your\\nmailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY\\nTHINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when\\nYOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no\\nmatter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!\\nYou will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you\\nhave will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody\\nJacobs, Richmond, VA\\n\\nHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$\\n\\nThis method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am\\nsure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.\\n\\nBefore you say \"No Way!\" please read this program carefully. This\\nis not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making\\nopportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all\\nmultilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new\\npartners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows\\nyou to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a\\nproduct for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE\\nFILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You\\ndo it privately in your own home, store, or office.\\n\\nThis is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:\\nThis is what you MUST do.\\n\\n1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell\\nthem if you don't have them).\\n\\n* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE\\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &\\nRETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).\\n\\n*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF\\nANY MAIL PROBLEMS!\\n\\n* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five\\nreports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on\\nyour computer and resell them.\\n\\n* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five\\nreports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for\\nyou to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.\\n\\n2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed\\nnext to each report, or their order\\non the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps \"a\"\\nthrough 'g\" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.\\nOnce you understand the way this works you'll also see how it\\ndoesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\\ntested, and if you alter it, it will not work.\\n\\na. Look below for the listing of available reports.\\n\\nb. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement\\nand remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has\\nmade it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!\\n\\nc. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.\\n\\nd. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.\\n\\ne. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3\\n\\nf. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.\\n\\ng. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.\\n\\nPlease make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy\\nand paste method works well,.\\n\\n3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,\\nand save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction\\nportion of this letter.\\n\\nYour cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely\\nyou can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet\\nConnection and e-mail is FREE!\\n\\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5\\nreports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing\\ninformation which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find\\nthousands of free classified ads and much, much more.\\n\\nHere are two primary methods of building your downline:\\n\\nMETHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL\\n\\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,\\nand we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000\\nprograms each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%\\nresponse. Using a good list, the response could be much better.\\nAlso, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs\\ninstead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out\\nonly 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders\\nfor REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000\\nprograms each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people\\nrespond and order REPORT #2.\\n\\nThose 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The\\n0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000\\nsend out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%\\nresponse to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to\\n10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about\\nlevel five!  That's $500,000 alone!\\n\\nYour total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000\\n+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE\\nYOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!\\nDARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF\\nSENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many\\npeople will do just that and more!\\n\\nREPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and\\ne-mail software.\\n\\nMETHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n\\n1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are\\nHUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to\\nstart small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to\\nget ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a\\nlot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.\\nAlso assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10\\ndownline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING\\nresults below:\\n\\n1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50\\n2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500\\n3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000\\n4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000\\n5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000\\n\\nTHIS TOTALS     -      $555,550\\n\\nRemember friends, this assumes that the people who participate\\nonly recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen\\nif they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of\\nparticipants.\\n\\nTHINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is\\ne-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE\\nSAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the\\ne-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be\\nprompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!\\n\\nAVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND\\nNAME ***\\n\\n* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT\\nACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make\\nsure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets\\nof paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of\\nthose sheets of paper include:\\n(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,\\n(b) your e-mail address, and\\n(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider\\nencounters problems).\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n\\nREPORT #1 \"The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet\"\\n\\nORDER REPORT #1 FROM:\\n\\nTony Goon\\n120 - 8511 Westminster Hwy.\\nRichmond, BC.

And, when\\nthey email you, send them this report in response!\\n\\nIf you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,\\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\\n\\nThen, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100\\norders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending\\ne-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders\\nfor REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already\\nworking for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!\\n\\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down\\non the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can\\nKEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\\nordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send\\nanother batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the\\nwhole process again! There is no limit to the income you will\\ngenerate from this business!\\n\\nBefore you make your decision as to whether or not you participate\\nin this program, answer one question ...\\nDO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I\\nam a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make\\npretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody\\nabout receiving \"junk mail.\" I made fun of the whole thing,\\nspouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.\\nI 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed\\nintelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of\\nher, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the\\nthing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks\\nshe had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had\\nreceived over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that\\nI had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer\\nnow. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby. \" I did have seven more\\nyears until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's\\nnot for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.\\n\\nThe. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this\\nsystem is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to\\nget a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached\\nseveral times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what\\none could expect in return for the minimal effort and money\\nrequired. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14\\nweeks, with money still coming in.\\n-Charles Morris, Esq.\\n\\nNot being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up\\nmy mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I\\ndecided that the initial investment was so little that there was\\njust no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my\\nmoney back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post\\noffice box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded\\nthat I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make\\nmore money this year than any 10 years of my life before.

ANDRE KOFFI REPLY ME BACK [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\n\\nDearest: Friend,\\n\\nMy Name is Mr.Andre Koffi a credit officer with the one\\nof the leading Bank (Finance Trust House) here in Cotonou Republic Du Benin.\\nIn my department i discovered an abandoned sum of (USD 32 m)  in an account\\nthat belongs to one of our foreigncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich,\\nGermany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash.\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nstm Since i got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of\\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some\\nbody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in\\nour banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his\\nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash\\nleaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that\\nI now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to\\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent\\ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go\\ninto the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here\\nstipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Five years, the money\\nwill be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of\\nforeigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the\\ncustomer was a foreigner and an Indigen cannot stand as next of kin to a\\nforeigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision\\nof a foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the\\nbusiness,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charity\\norganisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for me\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the\\npercentage indicated .\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you\\nmust apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased\\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone\\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the\\nmoney will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax\\nor email the text of the application .\\n\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free\\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required\\narrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting\\nto hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\nMr.Andre Koffi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to \\nmake fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left \\nwith no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my \\nclient who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that \\nhe and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an \\nEgyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this \\nfrom the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\nWEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nI am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to \\nthe government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years \\nof the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is \\nto seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the \\nlegacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his \\nnext-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great \\nconfidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you \\nand 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami \\nvictims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a \\ncodicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for \\nyou to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.\\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of \\ngetting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity \\nso as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of \\nthe oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the \\nsensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its \\nconfidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with \\nanybody, even if you decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nStephen Ayling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

Am married to Dr. Donald Holden. a Liberian who worked for Shell Oil Company in Nigeria,he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a child and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible forbids. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank.Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the RESERVE FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next Three(3) months due to my cancer problems.Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am going to instruct here in. I want a church tha t will use this fund on,orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. As soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country. I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- b eneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Christina Holden.

Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin.\\n \\nThe issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.\\nSoon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.\\n \\nIncidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.\\n \\n As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.\\nI can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.\\n \\nMy interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.\\nPls. keep these disclosures confidential.\\nThank you.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\nBarrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nTired of spam?

This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.\\n\\nI am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William\\nR. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. \\n\\nI received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.\\n\\nEarly this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. \\n\\n\\nI quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b!\\n y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. \\n\\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US: \\n\\nI will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.\\n\\nYour private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don't call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJ. Rodney Chesson.\\n\\n\\nN.B.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        FROM THE DESK OF : DR HASSAN DANTATA,\\nAUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,\\nAFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )\\nOUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Dr Hassan Dantata, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting \\nsection of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West \\nAfrica. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a \\nbusiness transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end \\nof the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nDr Hassan Dantata\\n\\nMOBILE: ( 00226 78 82 97 88 )\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
