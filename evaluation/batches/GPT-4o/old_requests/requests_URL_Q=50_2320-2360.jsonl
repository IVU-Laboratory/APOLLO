Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of \\nthe will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the \\nEnglish Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this \\nissue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I \\ntherefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if \\nyou decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nPaul Spencer. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

In my department we discovered an\\nabandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US\\ndollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR.\\nRICHARD BURSON from Florida, U.S.A) who died along with his entire family on\\nNovember 1999 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash you can\\nvisit this site: [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of\\nkin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless\\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as\\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that\\nthe money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the\\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for\\nit and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed\\ndormant fund.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin\\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a\\nforeigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a\\nforeigner.\\n\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the\\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred\\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your\\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to\\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply\\nfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a\\ntext of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the\\ntext of application form,I will like you to send me the following\\ninformatios\\n\\n1.NAME IN FULL:................................\\n2.ADDRESS:.......................................\\n3.NATIONALITY:...................................\\n4.AGE:.............................................\\n5.Sex..............................................\\n6.OCCUPATION:......................................\\n7.MARITAL STATUS:..................................\\n8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................\\n9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................\\n\\nso i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective\\ncommunication.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application form.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear\\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should\\ncontact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter,if only you are\\nintrested and ready to help.\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nDR.USMAN ADAMU\\nMANAGER AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT\\nBANK OF AFRICA\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Live Mail Beta !

I have B.SC in Public Administration and I work with\\nGLOBAL SECURITY & FINANCE LTD. I have now developed the interest in having a business investment outside Nigeria without my employers\\nknowing about it. Hence I contacted you for friendship and business\\nrelationship.\\n\\nThe fund in question proposed for this project is US$14.8million\\n(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only), which I will\\nlike you to receive on my behalf and to invest it in your business or in\\nany business that you think will be profitable in your country.\\n\\nPlease Note: This fund came as a result of a multi-national company that\\nwe helped to secure an oil drilling contract some years ago. Because of\\nour interest, the contract was over-invoiced to the above mentioned\\namount and after the contract, the company received their actual\\ncontract sum and went back to their country leaving behind this\\nover-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.\\n\\nNow the time has come for me to process and move the fund out for\\ninvestment, but I can not do it on my own since I am still working with\\nthe Global Security & Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that\\nI can use you or your company to process the release of the fund as if \\nyou are reciving a payment of an executed contract.\\n\\nPlease let me know about yourself/company and also let me know if you\\ncan be able to receive the money on my behalf and invest it in your\\ncompany or any good and profitable business in your country without\\nexposing me, so that we can commence with the process of transfer. \\nAll you need to send immediately is your FULL NAMES or COMPANY NAME and your TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS\\n\\nYour share will be 40% for your assistance, while I will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses that will be incurred in the cause of\\ntransfer.\\n\\nPlease write back if only you know you are capable enough to execute\\nthis project with me.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear friend,\\n\\n\\nI MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY \\nFACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN\\nCONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\\nAND USE. \\n\\nI am MR. Thomas Sarr, the manager of bill and exchange\\nat the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In\\nmy department I discovered an abandoned sum of\\nUS$8.5m,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US  \\nDollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs\\nto one of our  foreign customers who died along with\\nhis wife and only daughter in a plane \\ncrash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which\\ncrashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about\\nthe crash on visiting this site  \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an\\nAmerican and great industrialist and a resident of\\nAlaska. \\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided\\nto make this business proposal to you and for our bank\\nto release the money to you. You have to follow the\\ninstructions which I will send to you as the next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and\\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it\\nand I don't want this money to go into \\nour bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill. \\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if\\nsuch money remained unclaimed after three years, the \\nmoney will be transfered into the bank treasury as\\nunclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than \\nthree years and I am preparing documentations to prove\\nthat this money has been transfered to our bank\\ntreasury. It will be between me and you only that will\\nknow that the money is not transfered into our\\ntreasury. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis transaction is occasioned by the fact that the\\ncustomer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand\\nas next of kin to a foreigner. \\n\\nIn appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you\\n30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of\\ntransfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during\\nthe course of transaction, while the remaining 65% \\nis  for me. \\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax\\nor email the text of the application which you will\\ncomplete and forward to our bank asking for this money\\nto be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris\\nThomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that\\nthis transaction is hitch-free and that you should not\\nentertain any fear as all required arrangements have\\nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me\\nimmediately as soon as you receive this mail through\\nthe above email.\\n  \\nPLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.\\nPLEASE DO CONSIDER MY REQUEST AS URGENT. \\n\\nYou may contact me also at sarrthom1@lycos.com.\\n\\nYours  Faithfully,\\n\\n\\nThomas SARR\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

My name is Mrs. Rose Ameeraly.\\n\\nAm a widow and a mother of two girls. We do not know each other and I'm wondering how you will view this letter. Please, accept my sincere apology. Sorry, about taking your time as well. I will be highly obliged if you can assist me in this business. My Husband is an Nigerian while I am a Ghanaian. My late husband, David Ameeraly, was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman. Prior to his death by plane crash, he was living with us in Accra, Ghana. He died November 1st 1990. This sad event occurred during one of his business trips to the US. Please, find below the website for more information. If you go through this publication critically, you will find my husband's name, David Ameeraly amongst others that lost their life on that fateful day as published by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nBefore the sudden death of my beloved husband, he planned to establish a business in Europe with the sum of US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). Unfortunately, he died before this venture could materialize. Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his properties (assets and money).\\n\\nSince I am a woman and my offsprings are all girls coupled with the fact that I do not have a male child, I was put under terrible pressure to stay clear from my legitimate husband estates According to their family culture/traditional believe, a woman is not allowed to run late\\nhusband business and worst of all, I was asked to move into David's younger brother's household as one of his wives. My problem started when I refused to be inherited by David's younger brother. Fortunately,  the proposed investment fund US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). that was deposited with the investment/security company was unknown to the family. As such, they did not ask for this. If not, it would have been a problem as there would have been nothing to fall back on. It's only our lawyer & my humble self that know of this fund. I have discussed this matter with the Finance company were the fund was lodged. This is the asset I have left and I need part of this money for my daughters school fees and to maintain my personal life as well. David's family was vehemently against my daughters education. All they intend doing,\\nwas to give them out for marriage at a tender age. According to the staff of the finance company, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money into an alternative bank account for safekeeping.\\n\\nLater it will be used for business investment which is subject to the advise of whoever that will be assisting us finally.\\nFor obvious reasons, I do not want the finance company's involvement.\\nThis transaction must be handled under strict confidentiality. At this juncture, I thought it wise to solicit your indispensable assistance to receiving this fund on my behalf. I do not have knowledge of funds management & business in general. I was a full-time housewife.\\nTherefore, this step depends on your trust-worthiness & ability to handle funds of this magnitude. All that is required of you, is to forward to me by email, your direct phone, fax, address or any other information you may deem helpful. I need the requested information for the purpose of securing the relevant documents in your name as my confidante/ bona fide beneficiary. Please, note that this transaction is legitimate and 100% hitch-free. We will not violate any known law of my country and that of yours. So, be rest-assured.\\nHowever, as soon as I receive your positive response to the above business transaction, I shall provide you with necessary transfer details. Note also, that you must convince me of your trust-worthiness and ability to keep secret. I have decided to compensate you with 30%\\nof the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% will be used to pursue my late husband's investment dream in real estate.\\nThanking you for your anticipated response as I look forward to hearing\\nfrom you.\\nI remain.\\nSincerely yours,\\nMrs.Rose David Ameeraly\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.\\n\\nYour role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. \\n\\nThe money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally .\\n\\nIt is a risk-free deal. \\n\\nMr Temi Efosa\\nMail to : tefosa2@37.com \\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nJoin Excite! - [URL]http://www.excite.com[/URL]\\nThe most personalized portal on the Web!\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I am  MR. BENJAMINE S.ADAM, the OPERATIONAL MANAGER of BANK OF AFRICA, (BOA)  BENIN.  There is an account opened in this bank in 1989 and since 1996 nobody  has operated on this account again. After going through some old files  in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out  urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account is Mr.PAULTON ALLEN, a foreigner, and a miner at D&D INVESMENT CO, a  geologist by profession and he died since 1996.  No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,  the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me  as well that this company does not know anything about this account and  the amount involved is (USD 45M).  I want to transfer the [USD 45M] Forty Five million United States  Dollars into a safe foreigners account abroad, but I don't know any  foreigner.
