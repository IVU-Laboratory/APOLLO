Would be nice to have a unified tool for DVD/CD burning - already I do my CD burning from dvdrecord since it is more recent.

It doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of \"files for xmame\" ;-) Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set here in Spain...).

Maybe you'll need to \"override\" other paths when doing the \"make\". Second, the \"%makeinstall\" macro automatically overrides many common values like \"prefix=\" or \"datadir=\", so it's completely redundant with the \"PREFIX=\" you're passing to it. Take a look at the \"Makefile\" you have at that point to see how the \"install\" target is, and what it uses. Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like the one in Rawhide ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave  the commission its latest layoff numbers. IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\") Only after \"months of surreptitious layoff notices\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected.  An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \"rebalancing\" and more employees than expected  taking voluntary layoffs.  Sorry, we're still back on \"rebalancing.\" Did IBM \"rightsize\" last quarter, too? IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees  from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh.  OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \"stealth layoffs,\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle  up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin.  It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first  half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost.  Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the \"Curious George\" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper.  Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers. IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\") Only after \"months of surreptitious layoff notices\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \"rebalancing\" and more employees than expected taking voluntary layoffs.  Sorry, we're still back on \"rebalancing.\" Did IBM \"rightsize\" last quarter, too? IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting.

WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET 5. SITE STATISTICS 0. INTRO Hello SourceForge.net Users, This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you. These databases manage everything from user authentication, session management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database- dependent website. Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2, a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the press release here: [URL]http://www.vasoftware.com[/URL] How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much difference other then the site will continue to grow and the SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months. If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site, please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always appreciate the feedback. Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the Open Source Community. Pat- Patrick McGovern Director, SourceForge.net 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source community can always obtain the software released by hosted projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world, as to provide better download times regardless of which network provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location. Three new download servers have recently been added to our network, further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest additions include servers hosted by: Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA); [URL]http://www.twtelecom.com[/URL] University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA) [URL]http://www.umn.edu[/URL] CESNET (Czech Republic) [URL]http://www.cesnet.cz[/URL] We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and the needs of the Open Source community. On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net 2.

I didn't subscribe to this list!!! You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful phrases here)\".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a check box that said \"Receive Site-wide updates, low volume\".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it truly is low volume.

Well, this mostly worked, despite Colm saying that \"you want the \"failed-disk\" *instead* of the second \"raid-disk\", not in addition to it\".  I suppose that means instead of: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         raid-disk       1 >  >         failed-disk     1  I should have had: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         failed-disk     1  It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive after the raid-disk one :)  Anyway. It's doesn't quite boot right, with /=/dev/md0 in fstab.

Any ideas why ?  My suspicion is that I've a lack of knowledge about how initrd works, so I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only, fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it.  Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it to load the initrd ?

Analysts\\nboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from\\nthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to what\\nthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what content\\ncontrol itself really means.\\n\\nThe most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not\\nwhether they may interfere with the power of the universal\\nlogic device, or whether they are effectual from the\\nstandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these\\nare all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental\\nproblem they present is in the political premises that they\\nhope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\"\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the\\nconcepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\\nTreaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May\\n20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The\\nWPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to\\ncontrol public uses of their works.\\n\\n*That's* the real game plan.\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the\\nmasses.  They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content\\ncontrol under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the\\npublic to overlook the clear public interest issues raised\\nby the specter of content control, and to confuse these\\nissues with private interest issues such as privacy and\\nsecurity.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on\\nthe bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's\\nreally on the line.\\n\\nIn America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral\\nrights\" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution\\naccords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive\\nrights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting\\nthe progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the\\npurpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though\\nthat result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights\\nstatutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court\\nexplicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good\\nreason.  In America, we implicitly understand the\\ndistinction between expression, the aspect of works to which\\ncopyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make\\nup a work, to which it does *not* apply.\\n\\nThe reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must\\nbe stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:\\ninformation is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it\\n*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,\\nhowever, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes\\nto \"universal content control\" for the sake of so-called\\n\"moral rights\" implemented at the behest of narrow content\\nindustry interests.\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage\\nthe general public, and more specifically producers of\\ninformation products in general, to identify content control\\nwith \"moral rights,\" blithely overlooking the real\\nimplications of information technology in a free society,\\nand the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding\\nthe freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the\\nprospects of information technology crucially depend.\\n\\nSeth Johnson\\n\\n-- \\n\\n[CC] Counter-copyright:\\n[URL]http://cyber.law.harvard.edu[/URL]\\n\\nI reserve no rights restricting copying, modification or\\ndistribution of this incidentally recorded communication. \\nOriginal authorship should be attributed reasonably, but\\nonly so far as such an expectation might hold for usual\\npractice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no\\nclaim of exclusive rights.\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This distribution includes the spamd/spamc components     which create a server that considerably speeds processing of mail. %prep %setup -q -n %{real_name}-%{real_version} ######################################################################## # Compilation/Installation Instructions (use macros/switches if possible) ######################################################################## %build    %{__perl} Makefile.PL LOCAL_RULES_DIR=/etc/spamassassin INSTALLDIRS=vendor PREFIX=%{_prefix}    make OPTIMIZE=\"$RPM_OPT_FLAGS\" PREFIX=%{_prefix} %install    rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT    %makeinstall PREFIX=%{buildroot}%{_prefix} \\                 INSTALLMAN1DIR=%{buildroot}%{_mandir}/man1 \\                 INSTALLMAN3DIR=%{buildroot}%{_mandir}/man3 \\                 LOCAL_RULES_DIR=%{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/spamassassin    install -m 0711 -D spamd/redhat-rc-script.sh %{buildroot}/etc/init.d/spamassassind %clean    rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT ######################################################################## # RPM file inclusion section (see CRUX guidelines) ######################################################################## %files %defattr(-,root,root) %attr(0711,root,root) /etc/init.d/spamassassind %attr(0644,root,root) %config(noreplace) /etc/spamassassin/* %attr(0755,root,root) %dir %{_datadir}/spamassassin %attr(0755,root,root) %{_bindir}/* %attr(0644,root,root) %{_datadir}/spamassassin/* %attr(-,root,root) %{_libdir}/* ######################################################################## # Changelog - Keep it short and simple ######################################################################## %changelog * Sun Apr 28 2002 Victor  - Initial Release _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours. It would be nice if it sees a header like: Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with  for ease of reading? And the same sort of problem seems to occur with base64 encoded messages.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences  -> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands  being issued and the responses. FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending  encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm  window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever  asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a  dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

I believe a suitable memorial\\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\\nchildren's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\\nWhat do you think should done with the space?\\n\\nJoe Adams\\nHillsdale, New Jersey\\n\\nI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\\nthat's designed by committee and that's gone through\\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold\\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\\nand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young\\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\\ntowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic\\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\\nhistorical museums and in New York there's barely a\\nlittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.\\nIt's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's\\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb\\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The festival will be held in Golden Gate\\nPark's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon\\n- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful\\nDead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of\\nthe late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.\\n\\nArtists participating in this event will permit recording of their\\nperformances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio\\nLicense (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set\\nDuo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,\\nceltic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band\\nAtticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.\\n\\nIn addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including\\nAshley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,\\nFrantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his\\nSideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!\\n\\nBen and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel\\nCatering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.\\n\\nProceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for\\nAudiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as\\nthe Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in\\ncyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual\\ntechnologies.\\n\\nThe Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to\\nhelp artists share music more directly with their fans, without\\nsacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages\\ncollaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business\\nmodel strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free\\nsoftware initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages\\nartists to share with one another and their fans\\n\\nAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their\\nwork. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks\\nor performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without\\nrelying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music\\ndistribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.\\nThe Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for\\npackaging and distributing music, which is where record companies\\ncurrently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF\\nis committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control\\nover their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.\\n\\nWhen: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm\\n\\nWhere: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the\\nJapanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive\\n\\nMore Information and Travel Directions:\\n[URL]http://www.eff.org[/URL]\\nLinks:\\n\\nEFF's Cafe Project:\\n[URL]http://www.eff.org[/URL]\\n\\nThe Open Audio License:\\n[URL]http://www.eff.org[/URL]\\n\\n- end -\\n\\n\\n*Help With Our Internet Blocking in Schools Study\\n\\nIf you know of any public school students, teachers, school\\nadministrators, school board members, parents, or recent public school\\nalumni in the United States who are willing to speak about the impact\\nof Internet blocking on educational opportunities, the EFF would like\\nto make contact with them.

What the WSJ said, appended below. The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\" of the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *Commerce*. If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called \"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide. If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear. In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center. Cheers, RAH - ------- [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1031705210159756235,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 11, 2002 REVIEW & OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273 fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2 =09az -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

Those who deny such a watershed event take a\\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\\n\\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\\ndealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\\nrepugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome.\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth.\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters \\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11.\\n\\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a\\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal\\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in high-rises.\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists.\\n\\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\\nidealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\\n\\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\\nsubsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \\nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \\nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \\nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\\n\\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into \"near-line\" \\narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \\narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \\nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \\nrecovered on demand.\\n\\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \\nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \\nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \\nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers \\nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \\ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\\n\\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \\neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \\nenvironments.\\n\\n\"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \\nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \\nfinancial documents and transaction records,\" said Mike Dooley, senior \\ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. \"Users may \\nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \\nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \\ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \\nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \\nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \\nenterprise applications.\"\\n\\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \\ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \\ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \\nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \\nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a \\nthree-year warranty.\\n\\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM \\nUltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. \\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation \\nserial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum \\ndata transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace \\nwith the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive \\nenvironments and enterprise applications.\\n\\nWith a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for \\nmanaging hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA \\nadvances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. \\nThe interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn \\nallows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with \\nincreased design flexibility and hot plug capability.\\n\\n\"Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that \\nhas previously been too expensive to keep on disk,\" said Dave Reinsel, \\nanalyst at IDC. \"The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and \\nwhen integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling \\ncost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have \\nbeen the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.\"\\n\\nAvailability\\nLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine \\nII and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in \\nthe fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus \\nII with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments \\nscheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.\\n\\nAbout Maxtor\\nMaxtor Corporation ([URL]www.maxtor.com[/URL] is one of the world's leading suppliers \\nof information storage solutions.
