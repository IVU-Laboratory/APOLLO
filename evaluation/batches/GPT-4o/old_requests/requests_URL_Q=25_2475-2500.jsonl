Test The CD, when you're 100% satisfied that the CD is everything and more than it claims to be -  then send $49.95 by check. money order or credit card. Our claim to fame, is that our addresses are deliverable!  The number #1 problem with email lists are  deliverability. You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased a list in  the past. Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago! Not ours, a new  volume CD comes out every 6-7 weeks.  Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists: 1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates.  2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No address with inappropriate or  profane wording survive!  3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the \"Web Poisoned\" e-mail addresses from the list. Our EXCLUSIVE system reduced these \"poison\" addresses to near zero. You may have seen CD's with 30, 40,  50 million addresses, not only do they contain many undeliverable addresses, but most are notorious for  millions of these \"poisoned\" email addresses. 4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known \"extremists\" and kicked off every one we could  find. NOTE:We maintain the world's largest list of individuals and groups that are opposed to any kind of  commercial e-marketing... they are gone, nuked! 5. All domains have been verified as valid.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir/Ma, \\nI am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!\\n 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : [URL]www.thisdayonline.com[/URL] , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!\\n 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10\\n% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.\\nBest Regards. \\nHajia Maryam Abacha.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  \\n\\nDr. Kataga Bakori\\nLagos, Nigeria.\\n23rd July 2002\\n\\n\\nAttention President/C.E.O\\n                   \\nDear Sir,\\n\\nREQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.\\n\\nFirstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as \\nbeing utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council \\n(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade \\nexhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with \\nyou in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and \\nhope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.\\n\\nWithin the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and \\nprojects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our \\ncontrol as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, \\nwhich we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a \\nforeign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual \\naccount to receive the funds.\\n\\nThe source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria \\nwhich lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded \\nthemselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The \\npresent civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors \\nand as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we \\nhave identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue \\nof our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was \\ntherefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas \\npartner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY \\nONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.\\n\\n the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed \\nso as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government \\nfinancial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation \\nof some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria \\n(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or \\nany other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main \\npartner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of \\naccount information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for \\npayment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, \\nand prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process \\nwould be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist \\nus in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 \\nmillion (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for \\ntaxation and miscellaneous expenses.\\n\\nThe business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and \\nconfidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful \\nexecution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will \\nnot disappoint me. \\n\\nI will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your \\nknowledge when I have heard from you.\\n\\nThanks for your co-operation,\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDr. Kataga Bakori\\n\\nNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 \\n7591666  \\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

To assist you\\nwith marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send\\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:  \\n  \\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  \\n==========================================================  \\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also\\nassume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be\\nmuch better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out\\nhundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).  \\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%\\nresponse, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  \\n  \\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\\nThat's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  \\n  \\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  \\n  \\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails\\nsent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.  \\n  \\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50\\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5  \\n  \\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).  \\nYour total income in this example is:  \\n1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \\+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000\\n\\nGrand Total=$555,550.00  \\n  \\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE\\nRESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF\\nMONEY !  \\n  \\n=========================================================  \\n  \\nREMEMBER FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU\\nMAILED TO.  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are\\nover 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me,\\nmany people will do just that, and more!  \\n  \\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  \\n=======================================================  \\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE\\nplaces to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get\\na larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add\\nMETHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is\\ne-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day\\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with\\nyour name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise\\nuntil they receive the report.  \\n  \\n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================  \\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.\\nCURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is\\nconcealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets\\nof paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR\\nE-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  \\n  \\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW!!  \\n====================================================  \\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n**REPORT # 1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net  \\n**  \\nOrder Report #1 from:  \\nB.H.  \\n218 Timberwood  \\nIrvine, Cal  92620\\n\\nUSA\\n\\n  \\n ________________________________________________________  \\n **REPORT # 2: The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the Net  \\n**  \\nOrder Report # 2 from:  \\n J.B.

If you did not, continue\\nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do.  \\n  \\n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX,\\nbecause the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to\\nroll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on\\nthe list, you are placed in front of a Different report.  \\n  \\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF\\nE-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.  There is NO LIMIT to the income\\nyou can generate from this business !!!  \\n  \\n======================================================  \\n  \\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  \\n  \\nYou have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the\\nrest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  \\n  \\n============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================  \\n  \\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant\\nwith a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received\\nthis program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of\\nthe whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages\\ninvolved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed\\nintelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless\\nfun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the\\nthing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received\\n50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00\\n........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois  \\n  \\n======================================================  \\n  \\n''Not being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to\\nparticipate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the\\ninitial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't\\nget enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I\\nfound my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in\\nthe first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter\\nwhere people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return\\nand so big.\"  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada  \\n  \\n=======================================================  \\n  \\n''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\\nelse.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not\\ndelete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money\\ncame within 22 weeks.\"  Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.  \\n  \\n=======================================================  \\n  \\n''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little\\ncost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days\\nthe money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end\\nof third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
