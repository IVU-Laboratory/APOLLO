He offended conservatives and the\\n# politically correct left with his 1998 novel \"Les Particules\\n# Elementaires\" (\"Atomised\" in English).\\n#\\n# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted\\n# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme\\n# admit he felt \"a quiver of glee\" every time a \"Palestinian\\n# terrorist\" was killed.\\n#\\n# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National\\n# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in\\n# bringing Houellebecq to trial.\\n#\\n# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying\\n# Houellebecq's comments amounted to \"Islamophobia\" and deserved to be\\n# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination\\n# and racism.\\n#\\n# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading\\n# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former\\n# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for\\n# sending Jews to death camps.\\n#\\n# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case\\n# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact\\n# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says\\n# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.\\n#\\n# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour\\n# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the\\n# article before it appeared.\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the\\n# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's\\n# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.\\n#\\n# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached\\n# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to\\n# love.\\n#\\n# Translated into 25 languages, \"Atomised\" incensed France's 1968\\n# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won\\n# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the\\n# world's biggest fiction prizes.\\n#\\n# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.\\n\\n- Gordon\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down\\nin price. Hearing that the only \"officially\" functional Windows player is\\nMusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch\\nis a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why\\ndo we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware\\nunit?\\n\\nAt first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows\\ncompatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides\\nsong management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a\\nbetter option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with\\nalmost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management,\\nvia Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your\\nPC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off\\nApple's officially endorsed player.\\n\\nLori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's\\nSIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of\\nwinferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the\\nfree copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees.

All CDs are professionally mastered works, so you're\\ngetting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail price tag. The\\nmp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. The only thing I find odd\\nabout this site is their proclamation of paying artists 50% of distribution\\nprofits, which I have to assume is 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The\\nartist selection contains some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.\\n\\n![TechTV's Computer\\nBasics]([URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n**CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS:** If you've got friends or family who want to\\nlearn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check\\nout the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore.

At first\\nGeorge and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-\\nadjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George\\nand Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty\\ncocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as\\nquickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology\\nprofessor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy\\nDennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic\\nexchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find\\nthemselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.\\nThroughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely\\nchoreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead,\\nalternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.\\nThankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost\\nunadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and\\nimpeccable timing. At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with\\nHumiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how\\nabout a little round of Get the Guests?\" This provides some idea of the\\nprecarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to\\nfinish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is\\nTaylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok,\\nI will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not\\nhave been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with\\nthe chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying\\nslaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax\\nor look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is\\nnot a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a\\nmemorable film that will stick with you for years to come.\\n\\n  * Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only) \\n  * Format: Black and White, Widescreen Anamorphic, Closed Captioned \\n  * Sound: (Dolby Digital 5.1) \\n  * Production Notes \\n\\nReview by Brett Trout\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWALLPAPER  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**purple flower forWallPapers** by tatosh  \\n![](/images/blank.gif) Posted on 7/17/2002 12:35:01 AM --  \\n\\n![purple flower by\\ntatosh]([URL]http://www.wincustomize.com[/URL]\\n\\n[Download]  \\-- [Zoom]  \\-- [Visit WinCustomize]\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]  \\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Create and decompress zip archives\\nwith the Chilkat Zip ActiveX control. The control provides easy access to\\nindividual files stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within\\nthe zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual files or files\\nmatching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to any directory, and the control's\\nmemory management allows any size file to be compressed or decompressed in a\\nconstant memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly from\\nmemory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files with wildcarding.\\nThere's even a real-time progress monitor for zip and unzip operations.\\nChilkat supports Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++\\nBuilder, and all languages that use ActiveX controls.\\n\\nin Java  \\n**Anfy Java 2.0**  \\nAnfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop wallpapers, or\\nscreensavers. Within the program's simple interface, you can quickly apply\\nreal-time graphic effects to GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-\\nmapped cube menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom rotators,\\nlens magnification, waving flags, animations, scrolling text, customizable IFS\\nfractals, color changers, light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.\\n\\nin Tools & Editors  \\n**VB-PowerWrap 3.1**  \\nDistribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with VB-PowerWrap. VB-\\nPowerWrap embeds all dependent and non-dependent files into the executable of\\nyour VB program, including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,\\nto create a single clickable application.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly\\nloss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a\\nshare in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated\\nearnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215\\nmillion related to previously announced restructuring actions. The world's\\nsecond largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a\\nthird from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut\\nanother 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.  \\n**MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%**\\n\\n**Apple meets lowered expectations**  \\nApple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched\\nanalysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools\\nfell short of the company's initial hopes. The company earned $32 million, or\\n9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year\\nago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48\\nbillion Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share,\\naccording to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the\\nrange of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6\\nbillion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents\\nper share.  \\n**APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%**\\n\\n**HP, EMC storage systems to work better together**  \\nSAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they\\nwere opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage\\nsystems work better together. However, the deal will not include technology\\nfrom Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage\\nsystem, an HP spokesman said.

Once a dot-com darling, the\\ncompany recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.

That's what users of the company's\\nfree e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the\\nword \"mocha\" and discover that while in transit, \"mocha\" mysteriously changes\\nto \"espresso.\" To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated\\nfilter to swap out a handful of words such as \"mocha\" that pertain to Web code\\nknown as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as \"Web\\nenhanced\" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the\\nrecipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as\\ntelling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change\\na password, for example.  \\nJuly 17, 2002, 4:00 AM PT |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n  \\n**Unisys splits Intel server line**  \\nUnisys, a specialist in high-end servers, is coming out with a new lower-cost\\nline of Intel-based servers as it gears up to promote the Itanium 2 chip.\\nUnisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon\\nprocessors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys'\\nvice president of server marketing.

The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the\\ndetails of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new\\narchitecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images,\\naccording to sources. The fastest versions of the new chips will offer\\nconsiderably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving\\nATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after\\nNvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--\\ncomes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two\\nwill remain close.  \\nJuly 17, 2002, 4:00 AM PT  |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n|  **From our partners:**  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\n**Truth is in the iMac of the beholder**  \\nBusiness Week  \\nIt's silly of Apple to try to squelch Internet rumors about its next moves.\\nJobs & Co. should rejoice that fans care enough to gossip.  \\nJuly 17, 2002  |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**eBags carries it off**  \\nBusiness Week  \\nThe dot-com boom's big spenders couldn't buy success, but this online luggage\\nvendor survived by making frugality its watchword.  \\nJuly 17, 2002  |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**Also from CNET:**  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nReal-time stock quotes from CNET News.com Investor.  \\n30-day free trial!  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |  ![Crucial\\nClicks]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |  **Digicams for summer shutterbugs**  \\nGoing on vacation, or just headed to the beach?

Seriously, this is not a prank!\\n\\nEver since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had a cup-o-java with\\nJake at Starbucks, I've been craving coffee. I can't see myself turning into a\\ncoffee junkie like Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being\\nthat my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited to the severe need\\nfor a quick morning wake-up or in an effort to keep warm on cold mornings when\\nout in the field back in my Marine Corps days.\\n\\nAs time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the typical geek vices of\\nsugar and caffeine, but I can't drink coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and\\nwhat's the point of drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An\\nartificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, Iowa. Most of what\\nDiana and I use sugar for has been modified to use Splenda instead, with good\\nresults. Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it usually\\nis. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from the nasty breath. It's\\nfun to test out the dragon-breath on the cat to see just how bad it really is.\\nIf Bootes sniffs a couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly\\nrecoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of minutes.

In what seems like a\\ndirect response, we're handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange\\nTitanium. I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly looking\\nforward to seeing what the new features will be all about, but I'm also\\ninterested in what Oracle will be bringing to the table. Better email\\nfunctionality, control and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up\\nbeing the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A; is a screenshot of what\\nOutlook may look like once Office 11 is released. It's an interesting concept\\nshot, showing some new ways they plan to handle email views.

Microsoft didn't bundle the\\nJava Virtual Machine with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has\\nbeen avaialble via the Windows Update site as a \"convenience\" to users. Part\\nof Sun's legal complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that\\nMicrosoft did not have the right to distribute their implementation via the\\nweb, though they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. So\\nessentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. Well, to avoid\\nfurther web distribution arguments, Microsoft has yanked the JVM from the\\nWindows Update site and all other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is\\nstill planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. You'll have to\\nplan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is still a ways off and you can't\\nget it from Microsoft at this point. If you need it for a new installation of\\nWindows XP in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their own\\ndistibution.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSTUFF  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Another Xeon Deal**  \\nServed up by Warren Dugas\\n\\n[URL]http://www.tigerdirect.com[/URL]\\ndetails.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P\\n\\nI mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual- Xeon workstations a\\nfew weeks back, which I know several of you took advantage of, but the $1999\\nprice tag likely scared off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon,\\ncheck this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 workstation with a\\nsingle 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses\\nfor both Windows 2000 Pro and NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there\\nis NO memory and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for\\nyourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. Also realize that\\nthese systems take RAMBUS memory, which will add a bit of cost, so be sure you\\nknow what you're getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure!\\nExpandability is also quite amazing with these machines.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Actually, the trend has been around for a while, but the\\nbigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these efforts. (Intel was never too crazy\\nabout the idea, either.) Now, it's a bona fide movement, and the latest\\n9.6-pound desktop- replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new\\nheights. But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these things\\nreally get so hot that you can press pants with them? Executive Editor John\\nMorris sorts it out for you.  \\n  \\n  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n  \\n|  ![advertisement]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n**click here for details**  \\n  \\n|  |  |  \\n  \\n![Crucial Clicks]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | **Intel's new insides**  \\nThe i845 chipset's many flavors are faster, better, and a lot more confusing.\\nRead before you shop.  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n\u0095 Gateway 300 series keeps PCs simple  \\n\u0095 Modernize your motherboard  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |  | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Most popular**  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Desktops**  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n1\\.

Their music catalogs were limited, the software\\nwas clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I\\nwondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of\\nfile sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com\u0092s Rhapsody, a\\nsubscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure\\nrecordings from all five major labels. And now I\u0092m rethinking my stance.\\n\\nRhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download\\nthem to a portable player, you\u0092ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD\\nburning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge,\\nand you can\u0092t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and\\nlots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons\\nof preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something\\nwith its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that\\nhas all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download\\nMP3s?

So\\nit doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.\"_\\n\\nAfter Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this\\nresponse makes the best argument.\\n\\n_\"The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to\\nonly one browser.\"_\\n\\nFew responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall\\ninto the Web user category.\\n\\n_\"As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no\\nmatter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.\"_\\n\\nQuite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while\\nnoting the difficulty of testing in every browser.\\n\\n_\"Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is\\nunderstandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the\\nremaining tiny minority has to be justified.\"_\\n\\nA few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost\\nefficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share\\nbrowser.  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\n\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions  | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

Some of the leading experts on content management solutions\\n(those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of\\nblogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way\\nyou communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share\\npearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that\\nare changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that\\nTHE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.\\nRegister for Gnomedex today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nOf the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I start\\nwith the basics, for that reason, I'm going to take things step-by-step,\\nfollowing my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult\\nconcepts. Despite having experience in programming, using a variety of\\nlanguages, I initially found AppleScript to be quite intimidating -- mostly\\nbecause something about the Script Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've\\nalready been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will\\ndefinitely be targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance\\nto get up to speed.\\n\\nI'm off to the Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week,\\nwhere it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very\\nbleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows\\ncommunity in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there\\nis probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing out on the\\nWeb cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while I'm in\\nthe car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at other Mac sites\\nwhen I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is being provided by\\nCrosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services I've found that can be\\nconfigured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I can still function on the\\nroad. I tested the service on my iBook this evening just to be sure.\\n\\nWith some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via my\\nKyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis.\\nUnfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't use\\nthe unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A landline\\nwill probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some updates on the\\ntrip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as\\nusual.\\n\\nSee You in August,  \\nJake Ludington  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeDOWNLOADS  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.thumpbunny.com[/URL]\\n\\nSeven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes this\\na game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to clear the\\nboard of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two or greater at a\\ntime. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring awards clearing of\\nlarger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no swearing, but you'll find\\nyourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- not to mention you can feel\\nsafe sharing this with kids.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeNETWORK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE**\\n\\n[URL]http://xamba.sourceforge.net[/URL]\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application\\nunnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, for\\nsmall office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this is the only\\nreal alternative. Installation and configuration is almost painless, making it\\neasy for your Windows machine to see apps on your Mac with little difficulty.\\nThe interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is quite easy to navigate, including\\nuser management, connection management, and share configuration into a\\nconvenient Prefernce pane.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSCRIPT  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\nTechnically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text\\nediting application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in\\nthe Script Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is\\nlocated in the AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the\\napplication for the first time reveals a small window divided in to two\\nsections, Description and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of\\nbuttons.\\n\\nIgnore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The\\nDescription pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later\\nwhat it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will\\ninvoke your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable\\napplication, the information in the description will show up in the start up\\nscreen.\\n\\nThe second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling\\napplications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for\\nscripting is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level\\ndrilling down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to\\nmanipulate with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating\\nthings from the bottom up. Telling the \"Applications\" folder to tell its\\n\"Jake\" subfolder to tell the application \"Jake's Media Player,\" located in\\nthat folder to do something could also be written by telling the script to\\naccess \"Jake's Media Player\" located in the \"Jake\" subfolder of the\\n\"Applications folder, The upcoming example will make this a bit more clear.\\n\\n**Buy One Inkjet Cartridge - GET TWO FREE!!** Buy 1 Get 2 FREE on Most Epson,\\nCanon, and Apple Cartridges.

This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is accessible\\nby everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTIP  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\nTraditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the\\ndesktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder\\nonly a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered\\nwith files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything\\nwhen my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay\\norganized. For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on\\nthe desktop, OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their\\nplace. Open the Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes\\nunder Show these items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons\\nto clutter the desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing\\nat all.\\n\\nTip by Jake\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

I forgot to mention that the String value's label is\\n\"Logging\" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger, eh? The oversight\\nwas totally my fault. I've been thinking about asking Gretchen and Brian to\\nhelp with future reviews. Don't be surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure\\nyou'd welcome a female perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our\\nlandlords pick a paint color for the \"office\" wall this evening. Does that\\nqualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the Internet? You\\nbetcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and rugs. I have a feeling I'll\\nbe the one tweaking furniture layout. Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet.\\nI wonder if Ikea has an affiliate program?\\n\\nI've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but did you know\\nthat it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If you send an HTML message\\nto someone who has a yahoo.com account, something may get lost in the\\ntranslation. Try sending this sentence: \"My medieval mocha has an expression\\nto evaluate.\" Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results\\nwill surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any\\nscripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit Marion\\nSchroll for making me aware of the \"problem.\" It's kinda funny, in a weird\\nsort of way. Not that I would want anything I send changed in any way, shape,\\nor form. It begs the question: what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give\\nthem a bit, and they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's\\nthrow away.\\n\\nI really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: \"What is this crazy\\nbusiness with the broadband metering? What they advertise doesn't seem to be\\nwhat you get. Now that I'm forking out $60 per month for a supposed metered\\nrate of 640 down / 320 up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not\\nsure what I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure if\\nI'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me out here? I'm\\nfeeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig is full? That is what\\nthey promised me and that is what I THOUGHT I was paying for. I want\\nconsistent speed - is this too much to ask?\" It's not too much to ask the\\nquestion, but it's probably too much to get the answer. I'm facing the same\\ndilemma right now, even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my\\narea.

Even the new rhythmbox works (if you can call taking 5 minutes to load my mp3 directory \"working\"). It might be something with Ximian's Gnome 2 snaps. AFAIK, they're  pretty much straight out of CVS and hence a lot more experimental than  some of the other Gnome 2 packages out there. gary _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It's just not EASY yet.  I'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.

Secure IE\\n02. Disk cleanup on XP\\n03. Thanks but no thanks\\n04. Mouseless way home\\n05. Kartoo\\n06. XP time feature\\n07. Leaf Peeper Alert\\n08. Saving scraps\\n09. Quick access\\n10. Don't believe your email\\n\\nAnd What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium\\n\\n01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has \\nbeen giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks \\nFlash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize \\nSecurity Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up \\nto five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky \\nnotes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server \\n(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe \\nis one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of \\nsoftware, check out what our Panel had to say at \\n[URL]http://www.NeatNetTricks.com[/URL] .  For a free trial download, \\nvisit [URL]http://www.secureie.com[/URL] .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, \\ngo to the NNT Store at [URL]http://www.NeatNetTricks.com[/URL] and get a super \\ndeal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day \\nguarantee, what's to lose?\\n\\n02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores \\nwith Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking \\non your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup \\nbutton to determine how many files can be safely deleted.\\n\\n03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of \\nless-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom \\nEtiquette at [URL]http://www.icbe.org[/URL] gets our recognition this issue.  It says \\nit's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and \\ntechnology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\nWest Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now \\nenjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane \\nis our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at \\n[URL]http://www.NeatNetTricks.com[/URL] and click on \"Recommend NNT.\"  Nothing could \\nbe easier.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 \\nto highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter \\nkey then takes you home.\\n\\n05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at \\n[URL]http://www.kartoo.net[/URL] is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that \\ndisplays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the \\nmore relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions \\nare revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more \\ncomplicated than the service itself.  Just try it.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\nYou should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at \\n[URL]http://www.NeatNetTricks.com[/URL] . We try to have several great products \\nthere at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. \\nCurrently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, \\nand the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the \\nusual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check \\nus out, you'll be glad you did.\\n\\n. . . . .\\n\\n06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore \\nrequired a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a \\nprogrammed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset \\nthat often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems \\ntray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.\\n\\n07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn \\nwill begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, \\nconsider [URL]http://www.stormfax.com[/URL] for a comprehensive collection \\nof links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.\\n\\n08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working \\nwith text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way \\nto save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and \\nclick/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, \\nit will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with \\nthe first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the \\napplication with which it was created.\\n\\n09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find \\nyourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut \\nicon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide \\nquick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and \\nselect Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can \\nremember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application \\nwhenever needed.\\n\\n10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with \\nvirus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a \\nconfirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the \\nattachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) \\nwill clear things up:\\n\\nNNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus \\nthat implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged \\nsubscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at \\nall)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a \\nwidespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will \\nall around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep \\nthese from going out except to legitimate subscribers?\\n\\nLyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it \\nisn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that \\npeople sometimes will add the \"join\" address to their address book and \\nthat is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not \\nto have their address books set to automatically add any email address \\nthat they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be \\nOutlook Express.\\n\\nWHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium \\nissue, including:\\n\\n*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system \\nmore secure.\\n\\n*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.\\n\\n*  Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free - \\nand at no cost?\\n\\n*  An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, \\nand other info.\\n\\n*  A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion \\nfeature.\\n\\n*  A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.\\n\\n*  Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your \\ncomputer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your \\ncomputer's power source.\\n\\n*  Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important \\npasswords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.\\n\\nAnd more!

Razor isn't your mail \\nserver. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. \\nNor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their \\nmail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, \\nnot when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, \\nit means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some \\npeople may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because \\nthey don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be \\nsleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean \\nthat at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. \\nKnowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are \\nconstantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over \\n10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people \\nalready recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database \\nbefore you would get your 1000 votes.\\n\\nAlso, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for \\nonly one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 \\nsleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value \\n99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.\\nIn RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the \\nthing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.\\n\\nAlso, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree \\non whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 \\nreports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) \\nmail.\\n\\nYou mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. \\nFirst, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the \\nlegitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the \\nmore people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see \\nthe mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read \\ntime, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, \\nre-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.\\n\\nSo I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.\\n\\n\tJehan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\\nfor high-tech professionals.

One bloke's opinion: Date: Sat, 01 Jun 2002 00:18:29 -0700 From: \"J.T.S. Moore\"  Reply-To: jtsmoore@pacificnet.net To: Marc MERLIN ,    Daniel Isacc Walker  CC: svlug@svlug.org, Rick Moen , sluglug@sluglug.ucsc.edu,    Peter Belew , \"Eric A. Perlman\" ,    i3e-off@cse.ucsc.edu, slug-web@sluglug.ucsc.edu Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening To all, I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake. Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members. I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.   One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter to Hobbyists.   The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement, but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a vegetarian.   I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.   I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine.  However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy. One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of preserving the educational/institutional market. Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish.  It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS. I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested persons to legally view it. I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone. Sincerely, J.T.S.
