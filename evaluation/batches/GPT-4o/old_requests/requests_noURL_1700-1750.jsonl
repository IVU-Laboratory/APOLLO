Whether\\nyou are looking for your dream job or trying to hire talented people, the\\nfull-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your IT\\ntalent solution today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nI've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project.\\nApparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers\\nvolunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. Linux\\nusers, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to\\nspend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a\\ngood cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations\\nthat might be in need of such skills. And, I've seen some very interesting\\nsuggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of\\nthe above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though.\\nkeep the subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and\\nsort through my email system.\\n\\nIt looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.\\nAccording to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee\\non its previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an\\nOS 10.2 upgrade at $129.\\n\\nI won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how\\ndifficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years.\\nRevenues, by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s\\nand early 2000\\. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income,\\nsome of which were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch\\nin the past few years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the\\nnewsletters will remain free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative\\nincome sources.\\n\\nOn a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According\\nto their most recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest\\nin the company's history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue.\\nThat doesn't put them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the\\nstrong quarter will only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much\\nof this revenue was the result of the Mandrake Linux User's Club.\\n\\nThe news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest\\npartnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded\\ncomputers for sale on WalMart.com. I would never have guessed that WalMart\\nwould lead the consumer Linux machine charge. They've had Mandrake boxes\\navailable for several months. Now, with the addition of both Lindows and\\nMandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail\\ncomputer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.\\n\\nHave a great Wednesday.\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

While I use a combination of fetchmail,\\nprocmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong\\ncontender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the\\nKDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.\\n\\nThere's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't\\nautomatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much\\ntime as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the\\nadditional step to check your email after opening the program would be an\\nirritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and\\nsimple configuration issue.\\n\\nTo force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon\\nin your KDE panel. Select \"Preferences\" and the \"Execute\" tab. In the Execute\\nwindow, change the command line to read:\\n\\n    kmail --check -caption \"%c\" %i %m\\n\\nThe addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail\\nwhen you open the program.\\n\\nFewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part XIII**\\n\\nAs you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for\\nnetworking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed\\nto stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It\\nshould come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux\\nkernel configuration is dense with details and options.\\n\\nI will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections\\nof the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock\\nconfiguration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.\\nYou're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be\\nused and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and\\nexternal). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.\\n\\nFor security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:\\n\\nThe Linux Security Quickstart HowTo  \\n  covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel\\nconfiguration issues\\n\\nLinux Network Security from Linux Planet  \\n  a nice tutorial on network security\\n\\nNetwork Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4  \\n  other approaches to network security\\n\\nThese should get you started.

Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message\\nlike every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS\\ndevelopers.

I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a\\nminute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I\\nwanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an\\nalternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of\\nyou using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and\\nthe word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in\\ndrinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized\\nHTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in\\ntheir new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another\\nfiltering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript\\nfunctions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time.

Those of us that have had to\\nmanage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software,\\nmaintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's\\ncertainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server\\nwith less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and\\nmaybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very\\nlong last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point\\nout that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true.\\nBut at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like\\nfunctions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained\\nstaff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional\\ntraining, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it\\ncomes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use\\nWindows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement.

Tonight, a handful of Bay\\nGnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore. Melanie, Steve,\\nBrent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and Mindy had a total blast.\\nWell, it wasn't much fun when Robert got his digital camera confiscated - but\\nthis was a show worthy of five megapixels (believe me)! Brent went to the show\\nlast night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this afternoon. They were\\nselling a new CD (which had JUST been released the other day); \"They Got Lost\"\\nis full of a few previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about\\npurchasing it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic\\naccount and download a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the\\nopening act: Noe Venable. She's got a few free MP3s on her site, too. Give\\n\"Boots\" a shot - very nice.\\n\\nDoes anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me as a gift\\n(which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the manual - but the ones\\nand zeros start to look eerily similar after flipping past the first page. You\\nknow me: I'm not much of a math guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day\\nthat 'byte' was short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'\\nrepresented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece, but it just\\nisn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that? I'm ready to walk on the\\nwild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've\\nbeen known to do nutty things on a moment's notice, like changing my default\\nWeb browser. Courtesy of Asa Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD,\\nand t-shirt (which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too\\njealous; Mozilla.org has plenty of goodies to go around.\\n\\nLooks as though Jake and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis. They're\\nat the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds of well-known\\nprogram programmers - the people who make our computers work the way we want\\nthem to work! We're doing our best to convince them to join us at Gnomedex.\\nThey ask: \"Who else is going to be there?\" We answer: \"People who don't know\\nyou yet.\" They ask: \"Then why should I come?\" We answer: \"Because it's a\\nbusiness opportunity for you.\" They ask: \"What if I don't want to learn\\nanything or meet anybody?\" We answer: \"We can't really help you there, but\\nhere - have lunch on us.\" They ask: \"Oh, the admission price includes food at\\nat Gnomedex?\" We answer: \"We cannot provide every meal, but you won't go\\nhungry.\" They ask: \"So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there.\" We\\nanswer: \"You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.\" Get\\nit? Got it?

GigAlarm can play a\\nWAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program,\\nor use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the\\nhabit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too\\nlong on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!)

Alex writes: \"Did you know that you can\\ncopy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?\" Alex also\\nhad this to say: \"When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a\\nnew location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from\\nthe old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse\\nbutton to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right\\nmouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text\\n(along with several other options).\" Those are some great time saving tips\\nAlex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X\\nto cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then\\njust text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the\\nright-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving\\nyourself some time.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

I know that Jake, Chris and\\nRandy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and\\nI'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in\\nthe words of many industry insiders, \"The show of the year.\" It was unlike any\\nother computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've\\nattended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a\\nhuge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all\\nabout - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts,\\nand learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No\\nhassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find\\na better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of\\nluminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet\\nfor computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I\\nreally do hope to see you there.\\n\\nAnother Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores.\\nThat's right. Jake has release a **FREE** GnomeTome on \"Converting Vinyl LPs\\nto CD.\" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well,\\nmy age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't\\nknow if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead\\n- \"Gnome\" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there,\\ncheck out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.\\n\\nHave a great Tuesday.\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

You can use\\nit equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been\\nsomething of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a\\nbrowser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question -\\nit's a web browser and a web broswer only.\\n\\nRegardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror\\nbrowser and end up in your /home/ _user_ directory. Have no fear, though. It's\\nan easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.\\n\\nOpen Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select \"Configure\\nKonqueror,\" and leave the default selection of \"File Manager\" as is. In the\\ntext box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the \"Home URL\"\\ntext box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the\\nhome URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home\\npage. Select OK to close the window.\\n\\nTaking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser\\nto open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select \"Window\" and \"Save\\nView Profile, 'Web Browsing.'\" This will futher save the URL and allow your\\nthe opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.\\n\\nKonqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it\\nact like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part XII**\\n\\nDepending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for \"Redundant Array of\\nIndependent Discs\" or \"Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs.\" No matter. They\\nboth point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy.\\nThat's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.\\n\\nLet's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple\\ndiscs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally,\\nthere are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and\\nRAID-5.\\n\\nLinear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In\\nother words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no\\nredundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further,\\nthere's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one\\ndrive in the RAID array at a time.\\n\\nRAID-0 \"stripes\" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the\\nfirst drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no\\nredundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives,\\nnot all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0\\nwill, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.\\n\\nRAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, _does_ provide data redundancy. This is the\\nfirst level in which data is \"mirrored\" across the drives in the RAID array.\\nAll data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at\\nleast two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall\\nRAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can\\nactually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is\\nwritten across multiple discs.\\n\\nRAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity\\ninformation while striping the data across the others. This is much like\\nLinear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data\\n_can_ be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but\\nthis really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is\\nprobably the least used of the RAID schemes.\\n\\nRAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed.\\nLike RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than\\nreserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the\\narray. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can\\nbe accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a \"spare disc\" configuration\\nwill allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after\\nthe failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5\\nis probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.\\n\\nWith all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel\\nconfiguration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to\\nconfigure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel\\nconfiguration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the\\nRAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate\\noption.\\n\\nTomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**SaveMyModem**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://web.genie.it[/URL]\\n\\n\"SaveMyModem is an anti-spam, mail-shaping, and delete-on-server mail tool.

The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter\\nwill continued to be published every Friday\\n\\nWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one\\nis giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in\\norder to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months\\nnow, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little\\ntired.\\n\\nAlso, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or\\nmeet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time\\nto get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.\\nSo it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\\n\\nHaving additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects\\nI've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer\\nElectronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are\\nnailed down.\\n\\nFor now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn\\nout to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer\\nand see how it works.\\n\\nI appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be\\nless frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-\\ndemand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDavid Coursey  \\nExecutive Editor  \\nAnchorDesk\\n\\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Sign up for morefree newsletters from ZDNet**  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![ZDNet]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | Home\\n|eBusiness | Security | Networking | Applications | Platforms | Hardware |\\nCareers | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit  This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like \"%makeinstall\" or \"make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}\" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the unpacking and building processes.

No, they do not (what would be the use of that, anyway?).

I still disagree with the  reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions  that I'm on the losing end of :) The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I  don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching  the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is  patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when  I get a chance.

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's  not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with  full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local  use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above  technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for  everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This  just makes it a little bit faster. gary _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who \"forgot\" to _leave off_ the leading '%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4. Confused? Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what I found \"documented\" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes: Line 46: \t- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only. Line 49: \t- bail on %files macro. Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro? Line 172-174: \t- add \"rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)\" to track \t    %post -p \"/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib\" \t  incompatibilities. I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:   1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If      you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:      error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib   2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later. > --  > On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me >        A badly configured newsreader >  > _______________________________________________ > RPM-List mailing list  > [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL] >  _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

It's\\ncompletely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to\\nsee. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for\\nthemselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.\\n\\nContrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to\\ndetermine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point\\nsomething becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\"\\n\\nThe unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly\\nineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about\\na 40% hit rate.

It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced mature sperm when grafted in mice. \"It might work for primates or even humans,\" claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study.  If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy their ability to make sperm. Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to mature and produce sperm. Infectious particles  The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer remission.  But the grafting approach \"would eliminate any possibility of passing cancer cells back to the patient,\" says reproductive biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University. However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some scientists wary of the idea. \"I would very much hesitate to say that it's something we should be doing,\" says reproductive biologist Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School. Castrated mice  In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or pig sperm. When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen for several weeks. Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. \"We think that's a very real application,\" she says. She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new contraceptives on human sperm production.

I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers. I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?). Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

John Cusack and Tim Robbins make this comedy\\nwork, starring as the two security guards as they send up all sorts of\\nHollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh at the ridiculous predicaments\\nthese two survive, as they are greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and\\nmovie industry names. I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list\\nthis movie on a resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of\\nthem, especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each\\nother. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's underground\\nclassics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant to those out there who\\nare looking to put it to the man. If you've ever hated the recording industry\\nand its in-crowd attitude, you'll love this film. A closing reference to\\nRene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa Monica, which is a regular stop for me every\\ntime I'm in the LA area, prompted me to want to watch the film for a second\\nviewing. The movie is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really\\ngrabs attention on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one\\nwill buy it anyway.\\n\\n  * Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only) \\n  * Color, Closed Captioned, Widescreen \\n  * Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1 (English) \\n  * Audio Commentary - Bill Fishman - Director, Michael Nesmith - Executive Producer, Catherine Hardwicke - Production Designer \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWALLPAPER  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**A N N I H I L A T I O N forAbstract** by prelude  \\n![](images/blank.gif) Posted on 7/11/02 2:15PM --  \\n\\n![Abstract by\\nprelude]([URL]http://www.deskmod.com[/URL]\\n\\n[Download]  \\-- [Zoom]  \\-- [Visit DeskMod]\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]  \\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot\\nwith their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply,\\nthe fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project. Using this slick little\\napp, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully\\nfunctional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running\\nWindows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice\\ncubes in the blasted lands.\\n\\nLet's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver\\nOffice and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install\\nscript. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to\\nbe launched individually from a shared window.\\n\\nI started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD\\ndrive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd\\nexpect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always\\nhave, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a\\nWindows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.\\n\\nEven Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver\\nOffice package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of\\nthe install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I\\nwas just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell\\nwhether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.\\n\\nFor the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE\\ninstall was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to\\ncustomize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull\\ntogether legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup.\\nEven printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\"\\ndriver.\\n\\nLet me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project\\nwalk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always\\nsuspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the\\nfinancial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well\\nfounded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a\\nlevel of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the\\nspectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these\\nproducts could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows\\nusers to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't\\nneed to fear those losses any more.\\n\\nA note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you\\nwell know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a\\ncase in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply\\nwasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs\\ntheir minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems\\nto be the perfect pay model for Linux.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part X**\\n\\nToday we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux\\nkernel configuration.\\n\\nThere's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question,\\n\"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have\\nall the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If\\nyou're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead\\nof PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other\\nhand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be\\nfilled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.\\n\\nSee, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the\\nhigh points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion\\nof PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the\\nconfiguration has been pretty straightforward.\\n\\nTomorrow, we _will_ dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device\\nkernel configuration.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**LiquidWar**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.ufoot.org[/URL]\\n\\n\"Liquid War is a truly original multiplayer wargame.

Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now, some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs **doing something about it**. And what about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider? Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of these leaks.

In fact, both AT&T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo\"s new dial-up service. **Is your ISP safe from hackers?**   Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard about security issues, but should you count on their skills to ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this week\"s column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own hands and shows you how to protect yourself. ![3D\"The](3D\"[URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]\")   ![](3D\"[URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]\")   **Domain names**   A domain name provides an online identity and contact point for your business, organization, or project.

Twenty-five bucks wasn't steep, but the principle of\\npaying for a former freebie was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though;\\nsurprising myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd rather\\ndish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.\\n\\nThat's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that most of us\\nhave gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail accounts, most \"free\" Web\\ne-mailers have started charging for premium services or imposing strict\\nlimitations on free accounts. Read our reviews of the four top services to see\\nwhat you get if you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you\\nwant to stay spam-free.\\n\\nSurfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app. The latest\\nversion of the popular file-sharing software BearShare now offers a paid\\nversion that lets you search and download without those annoying ads.

Now entering its fourth week as front-page news,\\nWorldCom woes continue to sap investor confidence. This week's big story: the\\ntop execs from the company are standing silent against government accusations\\nof wrongdoing.  \\n---|---  \\n**2** | **BearShare 4.0:**  \\nThis new version of the well-known peer-to-peer software was been completely\\nredesigned and comes in two flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This\\nis nice touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area: downloading\\nmusic. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's tests, it had an abysmal\\nsuccess rate at actually returning files.  \\n**3** | **Jaguar:**  \\nWho ever heard of an operating system release being early? Well, Apple is\\nmanaging to pull off the impossible; it intends to ship an update to OS X in\\nAugust, instead of the anticipated late fall time frame.  \\n**4** | **Warcraft III:**  \\nAh, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and sit in front of your computer.\\nWarcraft III has just been released--right in time for the good weather.\\nGameSpot calls it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it\\nfor you, there's another fighting game on deck (see No. 5).  \\n**5** | **America's Army:**  \\nAs Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army\\nwants _you_ to play PC games. That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3\\nmillion developing its own title, and it has just launched a television\\ncampaign to drum up interest. Apparently, the campaign is working, since CNET\\nusers made America's Army a top search term last week.  \\nFor more Buzz, click here.  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n**\\n\\n  * Live tech help: submit your question now\\n  * CNET News.com: Top CIOs on the future of IT\\n  * Find a job you love with more than 1 million postings\\n  * Editors' Choice Award: Pioneer's HTS-910DV\\n\\n**  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions  | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.
