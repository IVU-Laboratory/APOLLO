[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Gooday,\\n\\nWith warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. \\n\\nIt will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. \\n\\nMy name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.\\n\\nWhen the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !\\n En!\\ngland for 9years now. \\n\\nI am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. \\n\\nTo legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. \\n\\nFor valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.\\n\\nPlease, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. \\n\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nDonald Phiri. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I will start\\nby\\nintroducing myself to you.\\n\\nI am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson Gracious\\nObaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,\\nNigerian National\\nPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that you\\nwill be of a\\ngood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.\\nFor many years of marriage now between me and my husband, I\\nhave\\nnot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.\\nAs a result \\nof the respect given to local tradition culture and custom\\nhere in \\nNigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. With\\nthe situation of things\\nwith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am been\\nthreatened daily\\nby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband s\\nbrothers are not\\nleft outin this matter. \\n\\n\\nThis situation has really affected me psychologically.\\nAs at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,\\nhence I seek\\nyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a long\\nway in getting \\nme settled finally.\\n\\nI want to use this opportunity to move the sum of\\n(US$29.5M) into\\nyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your\\ncountry. This\\nsaid amount was given to my husband as gratification from\\nsome Foreign Oil\\nCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drilling\\nof Crude Oil\\nin Nigeria.\\n\\nAs a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hence\\nhe\\ngave me this money to keep in my personal account so that\\nhe can be\\nexonerated from the eyes of government security operatives\\nand the \\nCivil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body that\\nscrutinizes the activities of all\\ncivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for\\nofficial\\nmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connected\\nwith drugs; money laundry,\\nfirearms and looting which I believe will put fears in you\\nto render the \\nrequired assistance needed from you and consequently\\nwithdrawing your help for\\nsecurity reasons.\\n\\nHence the source of this said money is clean and clear.\\nThis money was deposited in my personalin name, and\\nthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically under\\nthe banking\\nprocedures which could have been the easiest, but because\\nof monetary\\ntransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,\\nthat is\\ndefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move\\nthis money out in cash to any\\ndestination where it will be easy for you to collect under\\ndiplomatic\\nimmunity.\\n\\nThis he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your response\\nand\\nwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish you\\non the next line of\\nacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transaction\\nis 100% risk free,\\nand my husband will not raise any alarm because he will not\\nlike to put\\nhimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, he\\nstands the\\nchange of loosing his job.\\n\\n\\nAs soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm to\\nme\\nthat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you up\\nthere in \\nyour country where I wish to live the rest of my life. I\\nwill be offering \\nyou 25% of this money for all your help at this time of\\nneed, while some\\npercentages has been  set aside for my Brother to\\ncomplement his efforts here. Be\\ninformed that this transaction will not last more than 14\\nworking days\\nand it will be concluded because every arrangement has been\\nput in place.\\nYour negative or positive response will be highly\\nappreciated.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMrs. Rose Obaseki\\n\\n\\n \\n___________________________________________\\n Look Good, Feel Good [URL]www.healthiest.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"AUT\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Please my dear,I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.I have secretly deposited the sum of $30,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications.\\n \\nThe money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number 009GM. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you.I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance.I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account.I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect the transfer accordingly.\\n \\nIs rest assured that the modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the successful transfer of the funds.So, you will be absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email with following details: \\n1.
