That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? \\n    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads \\n    were built by English expatriates. \\n\\n    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were \\n    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's \\n    the gauge they used. \\n\\n    Why did \"they\" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways \\n    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used \\n    that wheel spacing. \\n\\n    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried \\n    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, \\n    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel \\n    ruts... \\n\\nSnopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually \\nlargely true, albeit subject to interpretation.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \\nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \\n\\nIn its first day, I've already noticed: \\n\\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's \\nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \\nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \\nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \\n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \\nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news \\nsite, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \\nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \\n- Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them \\ncopies of any press coverage they receive.

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA ([URL]http://www.tmda.net[/URL]  In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). \t\t\t\t  -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.   Reasons:   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls   getservbyname() which does a lookup against \"smtp\" in /etc/services).   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead   of SMTP.   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv   which creates problems:     Postfix does not support \"-bv\" and returns in error     Exim does not support \"-t\" with \"-bv\" and returns in error     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.   \"whom\" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.       It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout     about this.  The \"-bv\" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in     /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's \"whom\" support using Exim's system filter:   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:     DATADIR     ALLOW_MODE_640     CRYPT_KEY_FILE     FINGERPRINT   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group \"mail\".   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:     message_filter = \"/etc/exim/filter\"     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:     # Exim filter     testprint \"local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}\"     testprint \"domain: ${domain: $h_From:}\"     if \"$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:\" is \"\" and         \"${domain: $h_From:}\" is \"kanga.nu\" and        \"${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}\" is \"true\"     then       pipe \"/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config\"       finish     endif   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for   your setup. Basic explanation:   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different   user, chgrp as appropriate.   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I   haven't investigated that end. Notes:   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if   you wish.   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA   configuration. Caveat Emptor.     ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a   \"hold\" delivery method (identical to \"confirm\" except it sends no   confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing   silent sidetracking of mail). --  J C Lawrence                 ---------(*)                Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas.  claw@kanga.nu               He lived as a devil, eh?\t\t   [URL]http://www.kanga.nu[/URL]  Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
