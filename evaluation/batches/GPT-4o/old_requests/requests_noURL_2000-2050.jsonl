I am moved to write you this letter. \\n\\nThis was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. \\n\\nHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation\\ntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over\\n(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State\\nDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim\\nof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and\\nstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of\\nconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and\\nconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where\\nthe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMrs. Mariam M.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section \\nof AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. \\nWith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to \\nkeep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service \\nafter we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nGeorge Path.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRetrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search ! \\n[URL]http://desktop.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I have urgent and\\n very\\nconfidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American Oil \\nconsultant/contractor\\nwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a\\nnumbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at\\nUS$35,000,000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon\\nmaturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got\\nno reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered\\nfrom his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further\\ninvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all\\nattempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered\\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his\\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This\\nsum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\\never come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the\\nexpiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\\nNigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\\nforiegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the\\nfruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some\\ncorrupt government officials.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately\\nyour full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the\\nnecessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next\\nof kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for\\ndrafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and\\nletter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\\nWe would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of\\nkin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel and\\nclaim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regional\\nAfrican country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house\\nto the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio\\nof 60% for me and 40% for you.\\n\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\\ntransaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch\\nManager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.\\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via\\nthe private email address below. Upon your response,I shall then provide\\nyou with more details and relevant documents that will help you\\nunderstand the transaction.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest\\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\\nshall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please\\nfurnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster\\ncommunication.

Let me quickly introduce the reason and myself why contacting you is very important. I am Kalister Maunda; a senior staff at the Office of the Minister of Petroleum Affairs in Angola. I have traveled along side with the Minister of Petroleum to your country in search of investors that would be interested to invest on our Petroleum Sector, it was in one of this trip that I was opportune to realize that the trips been made by the Minister is not for the search for an investor but for the search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan petroleum sector that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this discovery, but I later realized that I was the only one among other top staffs that was not aware of these happenings, investigation into this matter made me to know that even the president is involved. I suddenly realized that the BBC and the Excite news achieve below is true.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://apnews.excite.com[/URL]\\n.\\nOn arrival from the trip I made with the minister and went straight to confront my Head of Department, of my findings and he told me that he is aware of the whole situation, he went further to show me some documents that was used to withdraw some millions of American Dollars that was meant to be used to pay Oil contracting Firms in Angola, he said I should assist him in the search for a reputable and trust worthy business man that can assist us in transferring the funds to a safe place where it will be used for Future Investment.\\n.\\n    I am therefore asking for your opinion on this issue, will you be able to assist us in transferring and claiming the money of which some percentage of the total amount involved will be granted to you for assisting us and for the time you spent on the transaction.\\n.\\n    If you are willing and capable to assist us kindly provide us with details of how we can reach you by phone or by fax so that we can proceed to conclude this transaction. \\n.\\nYours Truly,\\nKalister Maunda [MISS]\\nkalika@spinfinder.com\\n.\\nThe information contained in this email message is confidential It is intended solely for the addressee.

We want a reliable \\nperson who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars ( \\n$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World\\nCountries.\\n\\nThis fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us\\nunder the budget allocation to our Ministry. This \\nbill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The\\ncontract has since been executed, \\ncommissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.\\nWe are left with the balance US$20.5M as part \\nof the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for\\nour own use. But under our protocol division, we \\nas civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This\\nis why we are soliciting your assistance in this \\nmanner and regard .\\n\\nAs you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address\\nfrom adverts in the business directory . I am the \\nChief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )\\nof the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \\n( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and\\nTROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. \\nOfficials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this\\nMinistry. We have been exercising patience for this \\nopportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity\\nwe cannot afford to miss.\\n\\nWe have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of\\nus and I and one of my colleagues \\ninvolved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,\\nupon the confirmation from you that the Certified \\nInternational Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.\\n\\nConsequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your\\ninterest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel \\nNo: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and\\nCity(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert \\nTelephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax\\nyou or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS \\nTRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get\\nthrough.\\nNOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please\\ninform us so that we can look for another reliable \\nperson who can assist in this respect. \\n\\nIt might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this\\ntransaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be \\ndiscovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual\\ntrust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this \\ntransaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and\\nsecurity had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured\\nand feel free to go into this transaction with \\nus.\\nBut let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and\\nyour prompt reply will be highly appreciated. \\nThank you, and God bless.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\nDR.

I would like to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty  a/c can serve as far as it can receive money. I am DR AHMED SHALAA. an accountant and personal confidant to Mr.Robert Rice who died together with his wife in a plane crash on the October 31st 1999 on their way to attendwedding in Boston, he is an American, a physician andindustrialist, he died without having anybeneficiary to his assets including his account here in Burkina Faso which he opened as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company before his untimely death in 1999. The amount involved is ($8.500.000.00USD) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), no other person knows about this account. I am contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary, I want to transfer the whole $8,500.000.00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand USD)  into a safe account abroad, but I don't know any foreigner. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Robert Rice is aforeigner too, and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the inheritance procedures. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount,55% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Sincerely,Dr.Ahmed Shalaa.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWith Windows Live Hotmail, you can personalize your inbox with your favorite color.\\n[URL]www.windowslive-hotmail.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
