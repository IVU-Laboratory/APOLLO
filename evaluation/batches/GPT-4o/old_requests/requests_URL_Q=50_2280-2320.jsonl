I am (SALIF ZONGO),The Head of file Department in \\nAfrican developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.\\n\\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and \\nreliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or \\nAllah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twelve \\nmillion U.S.Dollars ( 12M Us$) . In an account that belongs to one of our \\nforeign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July \\n2000) in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane \\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody \\nis coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury \\nas unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \\nbusiness and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i \\nwill visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages \\nindicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the \\nmoney will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax \\nor email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice \\nthat this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any \\natom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as \\nyou receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nSALIF ZONGO\\n\\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to \\nmove very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you \\nfinish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well \\nover this business.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Messenger: appels gratuits de PC  PC ! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to an European private bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. \\n\\nWhile I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president. \\n\\nYou can catch more of the story on this website: \\n[URL]http://www.yukos.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.opendemocracy.net[/URL] [URL]http://newsfromrussia.com[/URL] \\n\\nYOUR ROLE: \\nAll I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable the European bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. \\n\\nThe transaction has to be concluded in 2 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is out on bail. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will provide you with the details. \\n\\nThank you very much. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nOlsom Berghart(Mr) \\n\\nNB: Please contact me through this secure email: berolsom@indiatimes.com \\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"JPN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may \\nbe capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten \\nmillion, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to \\none of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in \\na plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at \\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines \\nasociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nUnclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during \\nthe business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues.\\n\\nThere after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \\naccording to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \\ntransfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to \\nthe bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your \\nreply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free \\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \\narrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nI expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nHoping to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR .ABU TOPIA\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRetrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search ! \\n[URL]http://desktop.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\n\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend,\\n\\nAttention Please.\\n\\n\\nSorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing \\nand Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou \\nBurkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to \\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both \\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank.

We (myself\\nand the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collect\\nthis money the Nigerian government will confisticate it and\\nsomeone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we have\\ndecided to contact you, hoping you will prove to\\nbe a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to the\\ndeceased customer to claim the total fund from his account\\nwith the bank so that the proceeds of his account can be\\npaid to you.\\n\\nBe assured that this transaction is risk free and we will\\ndo all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backing\\nit requirs so that both parties will be protected from\\nbreach of the law both locally and internationally.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with the\\nnext step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim to\\nyour account.

Last year,{Jan. 2006} my master died of a serious illness, but before his death, he told me in confidence of a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27,000,000.00) which he concealed in two trunk boxes and  deposited with a finance House in Cote D\u2019Ivoire. However, the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk to be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for export. Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health, he was afraid that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me that if he dies, I should try everything within my capability to make sure that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less privileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this deposit to me with a written instruction.  I have contacted the finance house over this issue, but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me, unless I bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLER'S relatives. This is a very tough situation for me, because since I lived with my master, he has not mentioned any of his family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you to the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining..\\nIf you can handle this with me, kindly respond back immediately and we will negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.\\nThanking you for your cooperation.\\nMiriam\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLive Earth is coming.\u00a0 Learn more about the hottest summer event - only on MSN.\\n[URL]http://liveearth.msn.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I have decided to contact you on a \\nbusiness transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end \\nof the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nMr Mohamat Ali.\\n\\nMOBILE: ( 00226 78 82 97 88 )\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

I am the manager of bill and\\nexchange at the foreign remittance department of\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)I am writing to seek\\nyour interest over a transaction.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of\\n$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In an\\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customer\\nwho died along with his entire family in November\\n2001  in a plane crash. Since we got information about\\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to\\ncome over and claim his money because we cannot\\nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our\\nbanking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin   or relation died\\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody\\nbehind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one\\nother official in my department have decided to make\\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to\\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is\\ncoming for it and we dont want this money to go into\\nthe Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if\\nsuch money remained unclaimed after five years, the\\nmoney will be transferred into the Bank's treasury as\\nunclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of\\nkin in this business is occasioned by the fact that\\nthe customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot\\nstand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as\\nforeign partner, in respect to the provision of a\\nforeign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses\\nincurred during the business and 50 % would be for me\\nand my colleague. There after I will visit your\\ncountry for disbursement of the fund according to the\\npercentages indicated in this proposal. Therefore to\\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as\\nrelations or next of kin of the deceased indicating\\nyour bank name, your bank account number, your private\\ntelephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where in the money will be\\nremitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by\\nemail the text of the application. I will not fail to\\nbring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch\\nfree and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for\\nthe transfer .\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you\\nreceive this letter.\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully RAJI RAJI\\nBill and Exchange Manager,\\nAfrica Development Bank (A.D.B)\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}
