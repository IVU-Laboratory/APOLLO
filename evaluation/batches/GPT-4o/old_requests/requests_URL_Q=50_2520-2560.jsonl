There is an account opened in this bank in 1999 and since \\n2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old \\nfiles in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out \\nurgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. \\nMorris Thompson, a foreigner, Business Man and a miner at Kruger Gold \\nCompany, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000. Ever then no \\nother person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has \\nno other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this \\ncompany does not know anything about this account and the money involved is \\nOne hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 136 Million).  \\nI want\\nus to first transfer US$ 36 Million from this money into your safe\\noverseas account before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner \\nbecause this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be \\napproved to any foreign account because the money is in United States \\nDollars and the former owner Mr. Morris Thompson is a foreigner too. I know \\nthat this message will come to you as surprise as we don\ufffdt know ourselves \\nbefore.\\n\\nWe will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine\\nbusiness. You can view the web site bellow for more information on our late \\nclient.\\n\\n[URL]http://archives.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nI only got your contact information from my secretary who operates\\ncomputer; with believe in God that you will never let me down in this \\nbusiness, considering my position as a public servant. You are the only \\nperson that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so \\nthat I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your \\nprivate telephone and fax numbers including the full details of your account \\nto be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face-to-face and sign a \\nbinding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money \\ninto your account where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your \\ncountry for withdrawal and sharing and other investment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner \\nwith foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation \\nto make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this \\npayment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which \\nI will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate with \\nme, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust \\naccording to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because this \\nopportunity may never come again in my life. I need a truthful and God \\nfearing person in this business because I don\ufffdt want to make a mistake so I \\nneed your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I don\ufffdt\\nwant anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should make \\nsecrecy and confidentiality our primary working condition, bearing in mind \\nthat I am a public servant. I will also use my position and influence to \\neffect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account \\nwith appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange \\ndepartment.\\n\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be giving 25% of the total\\namount, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred the process of the transfer. I look forward to your\\nearliest reply.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nJOHN MOKA\\nCONFIDENTIAL\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFind just what you're after on your PC with Windows Desktop Search - FREE! \\n[URL]http://desktop.msn.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Here in\\nNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute\\nwith years of outstanding service to the people of\\nAfrica.\\n\\nI have resolved to contact you through this medium\\nbased on business proposal that will be of mutual\\nbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars through\\na consultant company base on my research for a\\ntrustworthy and established person that understands\\ninvestment ethic for entering into a life time\\nprofitable joint partnership investment and also\\nco-operation with confidence and trust that you will\\nkeep the contents secret and divulged to any third\\nparty.\\n\\nTo be explicit and straight to the point. Some time\\nearly 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited a\\nconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.\\nAnd since then our client has failed to come forward\\nto claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.\\n\\nConsequently, in our bide to contact this client to\\nredeem the demurrage which his consignment had\\naccumulated we discovered that our client was the\\nformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who\\ndied of illness after he was de-throwed in the same\\nyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.\\n\\nSince the death of our client President Mobutou\\nSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to\\nclaim the consignment with us, which means that non of\\nhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of this\\nconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to\\nsecretly open the two boxes that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the\\ntwo boxes that were registered as treasure! r by our\\nclient actually contained a considerable amount of\\nmoney in United States Dollars amounting to about\\nUS$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have\\nbeen nursing plans secretly. I also found out from\\nenquiries and the foreign media that our late client\\nsiphoned a lot of money from his country while he was\\nin office as head of state.\\n\\nIt is my conviction that the consignment in our vault\\nwas part of the money that our client siphoned and now\\nthat he is dead there is no race to this money in our\\ncare.\\n\\nI am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me\\nin transferring this money out of nigeria to your\\ncountry for immediate investment with your assistance.\\nI have also decided that you will generously be\\nentitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt\\nof your reply confirming your willingness to assist me\\nof this transaction, I will immediately arrange and\\ntransfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to\\nyour name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the\\n\\ncomplete funds to your\\ncountry.\\n\\nyou have nothing to worry about, as I will be there\\nto assist you in anyway necessary with all proper\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free.\\n\\nPlease maintain absolute confidentiality on this\\nmatter.\\n\\nPlease reply to the above email address with your\\ntelephone and fax so that i can call you.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nYours faithfully.\\nMR.VICTOR KOVIS\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nsent by Excite Inbox - [URL]http://inbox.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\npowered by Excite UK - [URL]http://www.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"IRN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

In an account that \\nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \\nin (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about \\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his \\nmoney because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but \\nunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died \\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department \\nnow decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to \\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \\ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to \\ngo into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline \\nhere stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the \\nmoney will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The \\nrequest of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner.

He assured me of your capability and releability to champion this\\nbusiness opportunity.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a \\nplane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless\\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here \\nstipulates that if such money\\nremained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the \\nbank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in \\nthis business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in \\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location\\nwherein the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \\nmore explanations.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR ALI IBRAHIM..\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWindows Live Messenger sur i-mode : dialoguez avec vos amis depuis votre \\nmobile comme sur PC !

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nFROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO.AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT.BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE,LOME- TOGO. \\n \\nDear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard. \\n \\nI have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia. \\n \\n>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M). \\n \\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. \\n \\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. \\n \\nMay I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner. \\n \\nPlease, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. \\n \\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.\\n Yours Sincerely, Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nInvite your mail contacts to join your friends list with Windows Live Spaces.

My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.\\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will\\nwant you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set\\naside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses.

This\\nis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a \\ndependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange\\nand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence \\nand pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \\nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \\nhis soul rest in peace. \\n\\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \\ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \\nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \\nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \\nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \\nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \\n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\n\\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \\nas the beneficiary. \\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \\nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \\nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \\n\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \\n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \\nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\\nthe information We gathered from an associate \\nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \\nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \\ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \\n\\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \\nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \\nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \\naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\\ninformation to enable us discuss the \\nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\n\\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \\nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \\nus. \\n\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \\nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\\nThank you and God Bless. \\nBest Regards \\n\\n\\nCOL.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$39.5m dollars \\n(thirty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that \\nbelongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, \\nGermany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane \\ncrash. for more information about the crash you can visit this site:( \\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and \\nrelease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for \\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we \\ndon't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during \\nthe business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country \\nfor disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable \\nthe immediate transfer of this fund to your arranged, you must apply first \\nto the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of \\napplication form that I will send to you when I hear from you, so I will \\nlike you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and \\neffective communication and location where the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is \\nhitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all \\nrequired arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.\\n\\nDue to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a \u0093contract\u0094 for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.\\n\\nWhen Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. Please, check: ([URL]http://allafrica.com[/URL] Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services. \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Mike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.    \\n\\nThe money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is currently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money. \\n\\nWhat I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have authorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: (miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you.\\n \\nAs soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email address: drben211@yahoo.co.uk  \\nAs you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.\\n\\nKind personal regards,\\nDR. BEN MBOYE.  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Mr James Obulu\\nUnited Bank Of Africa.\\nCapetown Branch,\\nSouth Africa.\\nEmail:jobulu@webmail.co.za\\n\\nI am James Obulu, Bank Manager of United Bank Of\\nAfrica , capetown Branch.I have urgent and very\\nconfidential business proposition for you. On June 6\\n1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold\\nExploration Company,Mr.Jim Smith made a numbered\\ntime (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million\\nDollars) in my branch.\\nUpon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his\\nforwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we\\nsent a reminder and finally we discovered from his\\ncontract employers,Randgold Exploration company Ltd\\nthat Mr.Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.\\nOn further investigation,I found out that he did not\\nleave a WILL and all attempts to\\ntrace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made\\nfurther investigation and discovered that Mr.Jim\\nSmith did not declare any next of kin in all his\\nofficial documents,including his Bank Deposit\\npaperwork.\\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the\\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the\\nprincipal sum at the end of each year.No one will\\ncome forward to claim it.According to the South\\nAfrican Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,the\\nmoney\\nwill revert to the ownership of the South African\\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\\nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Jim\\nSmith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will\\nnot get into the hands of some corrupt officials.This\\nis simple,I will like you to provide me immediately\\nwith your full names and address so that the attorney\\nwill prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,\\nwhich will put you in place as the next of kin.I\\nwould also like you to scan you drivers license for\\nme.\\nWe shall employ the services of two attorneys for\\ndrafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the\\nnecessary documents and letter of\\nprobate/administration in your favour for the\\ntransfer.\\nA bank account in any part of the world, which you\\nprovide, will then facilitate the transfer of this\\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money\\nwill be paid into your account for us to share in the\\nratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk\\nat all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\\nbe done by the attorney and my position as the Branch\\nManager guarantees the successful execution of this\\ntransaction.\\nIf you are interested,please reply immediately.Upon\\nyour response,I shall then provide you with more\\ndetails and relevant documents that will help you\\nunderstand. Please\\nobserve utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that\\nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of\\nus because I shall require your assistance to invest\\nmy share in your country.\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via email.\\nThanks and regards,\\n\\nJames Obulu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ---\\n[URL]http://www.torba.com[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"DEU\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}
