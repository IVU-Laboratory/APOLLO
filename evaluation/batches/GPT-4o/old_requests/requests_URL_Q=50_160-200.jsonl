(It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. This one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@      set seq {}      set rseq {}      foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { +\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { +\t    # just ignore anything bogus +\t    continue; +\t}  \tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]  \tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {  \t    lappend seq $parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\" if you like, but I don't think an error is needed). But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck a \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before. If you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it, I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it. And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway, so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \\r instead. So I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here.   \\r continues to work of course. And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G). Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the \"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don't think we really need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then). kre --- select.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@      bindtags $w [list $w Entry]      bind $w \t{SelectTypein %W %A}      bind $w \t{SelectToggle %W } +    bind $w \t{SelectPrev %W }      bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w \t{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W} +    bind $w \t{SelectReturn %W %A}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w \t{SelectBackSpace %W} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@      append select(sel) $a      Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"      if ![info exists select(folder)] { -\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow +\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }      }  }  proc SelectBackSpace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@  proc SelectToggle {w} {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} { +\t    SelectTypein $w + +\t    return +\t}  \tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]  \tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"      } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@      }      Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"  } +proc SelectPrev {w} { +    global select +    if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tSelectTypein $w \"-\" +    } else { +\tcatch { +\t    incr select(sel) -1 +\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +\t} +        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\" +    } +}  proc SelectComplete { w } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@  \tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"      }  } -proc SelectReturn { w } { +proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +\tif {$a != {}} { +\t    SelectTypein $w $a +\t    return +\t}  \tif [info exists select(match)] {  \t    set select(sel) $select(match)  \t    unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@  \tunset select(folder)      }      $select(entry) configure -state disabled +    Exmh_Status \"\"      Exmh_Focus  }  proc SelectClear { w } { _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The written words are then translated\\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \\n\\n\"It went reasonably well half the time,\" said Mr Frederking, though it was\\nslow in translating phrases. \\n\\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\\nfield. \\n\\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\\nwork with further research and development. \\n\\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\\nUniversity. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \\n \\n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: \"The\\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\\n successful breeding season over the winter.\" \\n \\n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\\n station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the\\n cape, may have lost up to third of its population. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference. Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids  to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those  messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have changed. Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of  one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has  been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to  sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a  one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages  removed.

Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so... >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and  Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it  only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the  \"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename\" output in the debug log to see when sequences  are actually reread from disk. My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to  investigate that. >   | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less  >   | than 48 hours. >  > Have a good vacation. Thanks.

My recollection about the first message being valid is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting, for example, or you are selecting a message to display.  > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current  > folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the  > directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so... glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder * will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents. But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun. Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is already pretty tricky  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time, but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about the folder. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network [URL]www.panasas.com[/URL] welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British\\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \\n \\n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \\n \\n During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\\n the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are\\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. \\n \\n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\\n Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in\\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont\\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. \\n \\n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \\n \\n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \\n \\n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \\n \\n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!
