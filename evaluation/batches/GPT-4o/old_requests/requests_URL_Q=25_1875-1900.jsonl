VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \\nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \\nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \\nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \\nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \\nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \\neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \\nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \\nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \\nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \\nwrite more about what I learned. \\n\\n  \\n\\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \\nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \\nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \\ninfested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern. \\n\\n \\n\\n[IMG: [URL]http://www.joelonsoftware.com[/URL] (FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup)]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Glenn \"802.11b Networking News\" Fleishman took great \\nnotes through the talk: \\n\\n    Dan: Tim, you're a \"content or copyright holdertalk about these issues.\" \\n\\n    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. \\n    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is \\n    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over \\n    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the \\n    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. \\n\\n    Oblivion is fate of most books: \"Piracy would be the best thing for those \\n    books.\" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally \\n    like to respect the rights of creators. \"Piracy is a marginal act; it takes \\n    away some of the cream.\" \\n\\n    Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a \\n    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a \\n    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often \\n    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and \\n    position in bookstores. \\n\\n    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will \\n    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? \\n\\n    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media \\n    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're \\n    stuck for a long time with \"some mistakes.\"  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Dan Gillmor's eJournal[3]_)\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://blog.glennf.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\\n[3] [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Filmmakers \\n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \\n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \\n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \\n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \\n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances \\n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \\n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \\n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \\n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \\n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \\n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \\n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \\n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \\n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \\n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \\n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \\n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \\n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.msri.org[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\\n[3] [URL]http://www.acme.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of \\nbites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements \\nfrom these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF \\nfile for me.&#8221; \\n- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time \\nbadgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and \\nnot getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay \\nagain.

As \\nseveral people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their \\nmost recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used \\nto be the #1 \"mark\"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an \\nattempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and \\nGoogle bombing[3]. \\n\\nSpecifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked \\nsite, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the \\nlinked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for \"go to hell\"\\n[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for \"talentless hack\"[6] \\nno longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were \\npreviously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on \\nwhether Google is actively penalizing such sites. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have \\ncaused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on \\nmedium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far \\nas page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work \\nputting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive \\nwith complaints and speculation: \\n\\n- New update, pagerank death?[8] \\n- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \\n- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] \\n\\n(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no \\nlonger indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely \\nfalse. Searching diveintomark.org for \"gimli\"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]\\n, where \"Gimli\" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) \\n\\nRegardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly \\ndegraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam \\nsites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so \\ngood at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing \\nfrequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're \\ntracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It \\ndidn't take long. \\n\\n- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a \\nhotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems \\nunhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and \\nGoogle absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). \\n- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC \\nnewspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet \\nbetting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \\n- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent \\nsite, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself \\n(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I \\ndidn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't \\nthat helpful. \\n\\nMany people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com\\n[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their \\nresults for \"eminem\"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the \\nbeginning of the end of Google's reign?\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[2]  [URL]http://www.pradnetwork.com[/URL]\\n[3]  [URL]http://uber.nu[/URL]\\n[4]  [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[5]  [URL]http://www.microsoft.com[/URL]\\n[6]  [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[7]  [URL]http://www.ohmessylife.com[/URL]\\n[8]  [URL]http://www.webmasterworld.com[/URL]\\n[9]  [URL]http://www.webmasterworld.com[/URL]\\n[10] [URL]http://www.webmasterworld.com[/URL]\\n[11] [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[12] [URL]http://diveintomark.org[/URL]\\n[13] [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[14] [URL]http://www.venere.it[/URL]\\n[15] [URL]http://www.venere.it[/URL]\\n[16] [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[17] [URL]http://www.news-observer.com[/URL]\\n[18] [URL]http://www.linkslsgolfworld.com[/URL]\\n[19] [URL]http://www.nando.net[/URL]\\n[20] [URL]http://www.google.com[/URL]\\n[21] [URL]http://www.alltheweb.com[/URL]\\n[22] [URL]http://www.alltheweb.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
