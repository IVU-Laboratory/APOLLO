The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to  see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this  isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one  day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew  Iraq would be in here somewhere). \"Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,\" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official \"said that only a portion  of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.\" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, \"Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,\" said the San Francisco  Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the  economy. \"Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,\" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle Times) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] Bush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis  [URL]http://www.accessatlanta.com[/URL] President Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast Ports [URL]http://www.latimes.com[/URL],0,1021983.story Bush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port Talks Break Off (AP) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] White House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] Cooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] Bush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL] Trouble On The Docks [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,2_0864,00.html (Paid subscription required.)

[URL]http://www.technologyinsider.com[/URL]  ----------------------------------------------------------------- THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP ----------------------------------------------------------------- wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry \"fowl.\"  We mean \"foul.\" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite  service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics --  it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as  some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified \"major revisions\" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted  to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the  cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, \"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns.\" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch  waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB103403314258094560,00.html (Paid subscription required) Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchase [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1033939901346228393,00.html (Paid subscription required) 'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL] EchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hope [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL] F.C.C.

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). \"Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,\" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official \"said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.\" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, \"Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,\" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. \"Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,\" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle Times) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  Bush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis  [URL]http://www.accessatlanta.com[/URL]  President Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast Ports [URL]http://www.latimes.com[/URL],0,1021983.story  Bush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port Talks Break Off (AP) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  White House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  Cooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  Bush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]  Trouble On The Docks [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,2_0864,00.html  (Paid subscription required.)

Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified \"major revisions\" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, \"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns.\" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB103403314258094560,00.html  (Paid subscription required) Regulators Set to Block EchoStar's Hughes Purchase [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1033939901346228393,00.html  (Paid subscription required) 'Last-ditch effort' (Rocky Mountain News) [URL]http://tinyurl.com[/URL]  EchoStar, Hughes See a Glimmer of Hope [URL]http://www.thestreet.com[/URL]  F.C.C.

Use the \\ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \\n\\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \\ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \\nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or \\nviolate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer \\nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \\n\\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \\nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \\nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \\nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that \\nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I say \\nhalf-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with \\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, \\non any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \\nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \\n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \\n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a \\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them \\n(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). \\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\nbash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the \\nwindow. \\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\nthat's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\nin a single directory (d:\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell \\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\nI don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\nmy D drive I have d:\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\nHOME environment variable), d:\\work (contains directories for each work \\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\nall programs that download things), and d:\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\ncreated CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. \\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\home\\phone. It is not in \\nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \\nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \\nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \\nmy single most backed-up possession. \\n\\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  [URL]http://bitworking.org[/URL]\\n[2]  [URL]http://www.winterspeak.com[/URL]\\n[3]  [URL]http://www.annoyances.org[/URL]\\n[4]  [URL]http://www.mozilla.org[/URL]\\n[5]  [URL]http://www.gnu.org[/URL]\\n[6]  [URL]http://www.activestate.com[/URL]\\n[7]  [URL]http://www.lavasoftusa.com[/URL]\\n[8]  [URL]http://www.openoffice.org[/URL]\\n[9]  [URL]http://sillydog.org[/URL]\\n[10] [URL]http://gpoulose.home.att.net[/URL]\\n[11] [URL]http://www.vmware.com[/URL]\\n[12] [URL]http://www.openoffice.org[/URL]\\n[13] [URL]http://www.cygwin.com[/URL]\\n[14] [URL]http://diveintomark.org[/URL]\\n[15] [URL]http://www.ultraedit.com[/URL]\\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\\n[16] [URL]http://www.microsoft.com[/URL]\\n[17] [URL]http://www.cygwin.com[/URL]\\n[18] [URL]http://www.guidescope.com[/URL]\\n[19] [URL]http://download.com.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}
