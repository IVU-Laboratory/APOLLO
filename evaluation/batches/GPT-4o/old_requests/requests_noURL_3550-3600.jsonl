[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend, \u00a0 REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. \u00a0\u00a0 I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, weremandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitivepositions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very greatimportance for security reasons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yours Faithfully,\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Peter Olis. \u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------Encuentra tu casa r\u00e1pida y c\u00f3modamente.

Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.  Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.  Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  Thanking you in advance. Yours faithfully,  Deborah Kabila (Mrs.)  N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for  more explanations. ------------------------------------------------------------ [URL]http://Game.37.com[/URL]  <--- Free Games [URL]http://newJoke.com[/URL]   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African  leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank  existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which  belong to a Syria national who is now late.    When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor  withdrawals from this account for this long period, I  and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a  system investigation and discovered that non of the  family member nor relations of the late Syrian is  aware of this account.    This is the story in a nutshell.    Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer  this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all  related documents for this account. It is a careful  network and for the past eleven months we have worked  out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.      The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all  the accumulated interest the balance in this account  stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.    Now our questions are:-    1. Can you handle this project?  2. Can we give you this trust?  3. What will be your commission?    Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.    Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as  contained herein be accorded the necessary  attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.    We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this  project. send a mail for confirmation.

The name of the deceased man was\\n\\n(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany)\\nN.B. In other for you to believe me honestly, visit the web site to enable \\nyou know whether we can work together, below is the website.\\n\\n                    [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nYou have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I \\nwas arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank \\nmanagement for the annual audit of the year.\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane \\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \\nproposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation \\nto the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is \\ncoming for it and I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as \\nunclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by \\nthe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot \\nstand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any  \\nforeign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the \\ntime of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason \\nwhy it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the \\nnext of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will \\nneed the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after \\ndue verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank \\nwhere the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank \\naccount.\\n\\nI dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I \\nagree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect \\nto the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses \\nincurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will \\nvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. \\nTherefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you \\nmust apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in \\nthe money will be remitted.\\n\\nAll modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once \\nstarted will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full \\nsupport.\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any \\nprecaution there after.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter\\nreply to thi box. at;\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr,KAREM AHMED\\nBill and exchange manager,\\nBANK OF AFRICA\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nPersonnalisez votre Messenger avec Live.com \\n[URL]http://www.windowslive.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact \\nthrough international business enquiry on internet.\\n\\nI believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such \\nmagnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put \\nclaim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the \\nrequired approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put \\nin place and directives/needed information will be relayed to you as soon as \\nyou indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit \\nyour self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account \\nand would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request \\nas it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank \\naccount.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills \\netc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised \\nto keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from \\nservice after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole \\nsituation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And \\nask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund \\naccording to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either \\nin your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All \\nother necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I \\nsuggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this \\ndeal.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMR OMARU AMINU.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
