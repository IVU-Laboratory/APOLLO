Bolkiah, the wife of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former\\nFinance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf\\nIsland. I did not mean to amplify my extended royal family history, which\\nhas already been disseminated by the international media during the\\ncontroversial dispute that erupted between my husband and his stepbrother,\\nthe sultan of Brunei; His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin\\nWaddaulah.\\n\\nAs you may know from the international media, the sultan; His Majesty\\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin Waddaulah had accused my husband of\\nfinancial mismanagement and impropriety of US$76.8 million dollars. This\\nwas as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my husband's\\ncompany Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment\\nCompany to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my\\nhusband is in jail now, his bank accounts and private properties including\\na crude oil export refinery have been confiscated by the sultanate.\\n\\nFurthermore, during this unfortunate period I was advised to evacuate my\\nimmediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from\\nthe sultan and his security operatives, but luck ran against me on my\\nattempt to escape. The Sultan now keeps me under house arrest and I have\\nno access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I\\nam sending you this mail.\\n\\nBefore my In-castration, I was able to dispatch the sum of Fourteen\\nMillion United States Dollars (US$14M) in cash under special arrangement\\ninto the custody of a Private security and Trustee company for safe\\nkeeping abroad. This action was on the orders of my husband to me to\\nenable us start a new life. The money was packaged carefully into two and\\nkept in trunks. Hence I seek your good assistance to retrieve this money\\nand further invest into profitable investment in your country to\\nfacilitate future survival for my family abroad. I have decided to offer\\n20% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation.\\n\\nPlease I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust\\nwhile looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of\\nthis business transaction.\\n\\nMany Thanks & May Allah blessing remain with you, Amen.\\n\\nI remain yours sincerely\\n\\nPrincess Fayad .W.

My husband Joseph Ejercito estrada was elected as the 13th President of the Philippines in May 1998 by the people of Philippines due to his popularity in the film industry made him to win the largest popularity in the history of election in Philippines.He has attain the position of Senate in 1987,then vice-president in May 1992 and later become the president 1998.My husband became mayor of his hometown, San Juan in 1969 but it was 1972 that he had a string of public successes.

They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file!\\n before my husband in the impeachment trial; \\n\\n1. Gov.

On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial. \\n\\n\\n4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death. Presently !\\nlife has not been easy for my children and I,my travelling documents have been seized by the government and they restricted me and my children to have access to my husband.\\n\\n Haven seen the way things are going with us.He decided to let me know that he deposited some money with Bank in Europe.He said that he deposited the sum of twenty Million dollars $20,000,000 in Banesto Bank Valencia Spain.Now I want to start a new life with the money.I want to invest the money outside Philippines.

The amount in this account is  Fifty Five Million Five Hundred\\nThousand British Pound sterling. Since no one has come forth to claim\\nthese funds, the bank management is willing to welcome any foreigner who\\nhas correct information to this Account which I will give upon receipt of\\nyour positive response towards my proposal. I assure you a 100% that there\\nis no risk to this business. After its conclusion I will retrieve all\\ndocuments used in the transfer and destroy them in your presence, when I\\ncome over to your account base for sharin of funds and possible\\ninvestment.\\n\\nSharing will be 30% for you, 0.5% for any expenses incurred during this\\nbusiness 30% for charity organizations because this was one of the things\\nhe made known to me personaly before he died in the plane crash while the\\nremaining 35% for me.

On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.\\nAfter about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .\\nPlease do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will \\nbe of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of \\n7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.\\n\\nI therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your \\nurgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it \\nwill be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of \\nmovement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.\\n\\nThis money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband \\nand a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands \\nshare .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my \\nhusbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our \\naccounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and \\nthe arrest of my First son.\\n\\nIn view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of \\nour finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the \\nmoney in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this \\nfund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we \\nhave such funds.\\n\\nFurther more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years \\nfollowing the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder \\nand corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after \\nthe president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he \\nis still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital \\ndocuments.\\n\\nDue to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my \\nfamily,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in \\ntransferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to \\ninvest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist \\nme.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.\\n\\nI am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere \\nlike yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start \\nall over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over \\nto your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please \\ndo not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in \\ntotal trust and confidence.\\n\\nPlease kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal \\ntelephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the \\ntotal sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during \\nthecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until \\nwe can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent \\nto our free movement by the Senegal Government.\\n\\nI will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.\\nYour URGENT response is needed.\\n\\nRegards and God Bless you.\\n\\nMrs.Estelle Mamadou .\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \\n[URL]www.windowslivemessenger.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

I am (AZIZ KOFFI) a seniorstaff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got yourcontact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured ofyour capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity wheni prayed  to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003\u00a0\u00a0) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death,  \u00a0 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased asindicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at theplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. \u00a0 \u00a0The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will betransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visityour country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you asarranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of  the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank accountnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receiptof your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of theapplication I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on my number 00226 76 17 22 04.immediately as soonas you receive this letter. reply me with this e mail address aziz_koffi@latinmail.com immediately. Yours faithfully,AZIZ KOFFI \u00a0 POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as toenable thetransfer to move very smoothly in to the account you willprove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call meimmediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always..........................................................................................MSN Messenger  : appels gratuits de PC  PC partout dans le monde !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

A. E. I \\nwrite you this proposal in good faith, believing that I \\ncan trust you with the information I am about to reveal to \\nyou.\\n\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business \\nproposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign \\nOil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM \\nCORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) \\nfor 36 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 \\n(Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in \\nmy bank and I happen to be his account officer before I \\nwas moved to my present position recently.\\n\\n  Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as \\nwell the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the \\nmaturity date so I sent a routine notification to his \\nforwarding address but the letter was returned \\nundelivered.\\n\\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it \\nwas again returned and finally I discovered from his \\ncontract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. \\nKhalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand \\nof Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of \\nhis trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of \\nleaking information to the Americans. On further \\ninvestigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family \\nwife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was \\nthe reason why he did not declare any next of kin or \\nrelation in all his official documents, including his Bank \\nDeposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any\\nWILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and \\nplaced under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank \\nmanagement since no one have heard from the owner since \\n2003.\\n\\n  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have \\nmade so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am \\nthe only one that have the information.\\nWith the recent change of government in my country and \\nwith their efforts to support the United Nations in \\ncheckmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this \\nyear, the government will pass a new financial control law \\nwhich will give the government authority to interrogate \\naccount owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the \\nsource of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism \\nsupport. If I do not move this money out of the country \\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will \\ndefinitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot \\nprovide the account owner to explain the source of the \\nmoney. I cannot directly transfer out this money without \\nthe help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting \\nyou for an assistance.\\n\\n  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with \\nmy present position and status in the bank as Head of \\nRetail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the \\nrelease of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the \\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information \\nconcerning the account, which I shall give you. All \\ndocuments to enable you claim this fund will be carefully \\nworked out and there is practically no risk involved, the \\ntransaction will be executed under a legitimate \\narrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, \\nbeside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\n\\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you \\nwish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both \\nparties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact \\nme as soon as you receive this message so we can go over \\nthe details.

I am\\nMrs. BUSISIWE LUCY MCKNIGHT, the wife of LATE FREDRICK\\nMCKNIGHT, the former popular black farmer in Zimbabwe\\nwho is also a Famous politician, in the Zimbabwe\\npolitical arena. My husband was assonated by president\\nMugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to\\nagree with the so called president to take the lands/farms \\nof the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today.\\nBecause of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press \\non what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of\\nMugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare, \\nin Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well\\nknow by the masses. \\n\\nMy dear when this incident occurred at about 8.45 in Zimbabwe time, my husband \\ndid not die on the spotrather he was rushed to Harare hospital where he later died. \\nBefore the death of my husband, he had taken me and our son to South Africa to \\ndeposit the sum of US$32.5 million {Thirty two million five hundred thousand dollars} in a\\nsecurity company . And now I am in Zimbabwe but my son is in South Africa \\nwith the money deposited in asecurity company with the documents intact. Because of\\nthe country existing law, which bears asylum seekers/refugee like him \\n(my son) and also hisage not to operate an account that exceed US$2000.00\\nand the fear of the South African government not raising  eyebrows about the\\nmoney therein South Africa, I decided to write to you seek for your help \\nfor this money tobe transferred into your private bank account as all\\narrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care off.\\nAnd also due to my presentcondition here in Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his allied have\\nderide me the right of traveling outside the country, I am having a deadly \\ncancer ofthe breast which make me to be worried to see that\\nthis money is in a safe hand before anything happened to me, it is the \\nonly thing left for the upbringing of my children whom are still young before my\\nhusband left me. I want to assure you also that this \\ntransaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this \\napart from my first Son Samuel and I. Dear, as for your rewarding kind \\nassistance I have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, while 5% have \\nbeen mapped out for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this\\ntransaction.
