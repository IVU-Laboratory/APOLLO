This strategic\\npartnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security\\nprotocol used by every e-based\\ndesktop, laptop and server. \\n\\nUnder the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors\\nTechnology's award-winning Magi\\nEnterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and\\nencryption to every\\nMagi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow\\nbetween workgroups within and\\nbeyond the enterprise.\\n\\nSecure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly\\nnetwork infrastructures. This\\ncombination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific\\nsecurity tools for each desktop\\napplication such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration\\ncan now be rapidly, easily and\\nsecurely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,\\npartners and clients without concern\\nin compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact\\nhighly securely with strong\\nencryption and authentication across firewalls.\\n\\n\"In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,\" says\\nBernard Hulme, chairman and\\nCEO of Endeavors Technology. \"Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT\\nmanagers with added\\nassurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric\\npeer-to-peer computing\"\\n\\nEndeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete\\ninteroperability between\\npartner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA\\nClearTrust Web access\\nmanagement, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.\\n\\nThe strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging\\nand advertising, be listed in\\nRSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.\\nIt will also lead to joint\\nmarketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on\\njoint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide\\nbusiness continuity support.\\n\\n\"Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise\\nproducts and streamlining the\\ndeployment process for IT managers,\" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. \"By\\ncombining our products,\\nenterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.\"\\n\\nAbout Magi\\nMagi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure\\ninter- and intra-enterprise\\ncollaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for\\ncollaboration very rapidly and\\naffordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this\\nby effectively transforming\\nunsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through\\nthe use of such features as\\ncross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name\\nspaces generating \"follow me URLs\"\\nfor mobile professionals.\\n\\nAbout RSA Security, Inc.\\nRSA Security Inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations\\nfor e-business through its RSA\\nSecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon\\ndigital certificate\\nmanagement product families. With approximately one billion RSA BSAFE-enabled applications in use worldwide,\\nmore than ten million RSA\\nSecurID authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, RSA Security has the proven\\nleadership and innovative technology to\\naddress the changing security needs of e-business and bring trust to the online economy.

It occurs at the very end of an excellent article which I recommend to you. In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been listening to an heroic sermon about \"the glory to be won in battle by young patriots armed with the love of God.\" He usurps the pulpit and prays the following: \"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\" Twain wrote the story, \"The War Prayer,\" in 1905 during the American occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it \"unsuitable\" for publication at the time it was written. #  distributed via : no commercial use without permission #   is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, #  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets #  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and \"info nettime-l\" in the msg body #  archive: [URL]http://www.nettime.org[/URL] contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net --- end forwarded text --  ----------------- R.

But what this graphic editor will do is make quick    work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--    and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.    Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which    you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you    group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful    cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for    some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,    antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

Find your IT\\ntalent solution today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nYou're a good bunch, you Penguins.\\n\\nToday's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you\\na quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik\\nhas found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With\\nDiabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,\\nwith the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost\\nirrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively\\noffered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work\\nfor the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to\\neffect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little\\ncallous about the 'Net ...\\n\\nAccordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing\\npart of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can\\nfurther put our technical skills (be they Linux _or_ Windows skills) to work\\nfor a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort,\\nbased in the Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services\\nto worthwhile charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly\\ndescribes our purpose. Next, we need volunteers with the time and ability to\\nlend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to\\nthe charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe\\nthe organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain can\\nuse some hands-on or remote volunteer help.\\n\\nI'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the\\nAicardi Syndrome Foundation. Though I don't currently know their technical\\nneeds, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read \"research and technical\\ndollars are minimal.\" I'm sure we can, as a group, provide them a way to fill\\nexisting technical holes.\\n\\nThat's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make\\nothers.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging\\nprogram, GeekLog to pull together a community project area where interested\\nparties can gather, coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become.\\nI'll keep you posted on the details.\\n\\nIn one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor\\nPenguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their\\nprotection from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into\\nthe water, all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nWhere could the analogy possibly be more fitting?\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in\\nshortcuts you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to\\nchange your system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips\\nthat are quick and very easy to learn and remember.\\n\\nGot a cluttered console screen? Use **[ctrl]+l** to clear it. This does the\\nsame thing as the **clear** command with far fewer keystrokes.\\n\\nDo you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the **[ctrl+d** key\\ncombination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the\\ncurrent user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal\\nwindow, as well.\\n\\nTo me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can\\navoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then\\nI've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings\\nusing these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's\\nsubstantial.\\n\\nMaximum efficiency.

Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss\\nconfiguring block devices in your kernel.\\n\\nWe've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell\\nissues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and\\ncharacter devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.\\nBlock devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of\\ndata \"blocks.\" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of\\ndata to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly.\\nData intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your\\npower dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating\\ndata up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.\\n\\nCharacter devices, on the other hand, receive data in \"streams,\" one character\\nat a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle\\ndata input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer _then_\\ncommitting the data.\\n\\nThe physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining\\nwhy they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to\\nstore or retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of\\nthe disc surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know\\nwhere there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the\\ndisc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related\\ndata together.\\n\\nCharacter devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and\\nforget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and\\nphysical. The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm\\nPilot. The storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a\\nphysical storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive\\nand account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also\\nsend a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an\\nindication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as\\nwell.\\n\\nSo, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the\\nsystem for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a\\npredetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical\\nproperties of the hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest\\nlevel view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical\\ndata storage really is.\\n\\nIn the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data\\nstorage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about\\nyour existing hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you\\nusing? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the\\ndrive located - on the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because\\nthe variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock\\nconfiguration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. I can\\ntell you this - you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a\\nfloppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can.\\nFind out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the\\nconfiguration process will be relatively painless.\\n\\nA warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series\\ncontinues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration\\nrecommendations where possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make\\nsuch recommendations. However, where the variable set is as broad as block\\ndevices, much of the legwork will be up to you.\\n\\nTomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**rxLinux**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.fusionw3.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of\\nmultiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web\\ninterface is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers.\\nServers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the\\nconfiguration and software from a master server. No administration is done\\ndirectly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers.

I'm sure you do - but where did it come\\nfrom? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did\\nMicrosoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?\"\\n\\nHistory of LDAP\\n\\n[URL]http://www.microsoft.com[/URL]\\n\\nX.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a comprehensive Directory Service,\\nincluding an information model, namespace, functional model, and\\nauthentication framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol\\n(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full OSI protocol that\\ncontains extensive functionality, much of which is not used by most\\napplications.\\n\\nDAP is significantly more complicated than the more prevalent TCP/IP stack\\nimplementations and requires more code and computing horsepower to run. The\\nsize and complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, such as\\nthe PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality often comes with the machine.\\nDAP stack implementations are cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the\\nacceptance of X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, with\\nhelp from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed a protocol that would\\nwork over TCP/IP and was small enough when implemented to run on a thin client\\nlike PC's running the Windows operating system or the Macintosh.\\n\\nThe LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March of 1994. The LDAP\\nversion 2 Specification was published as rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and\\nIndexing of Directories (ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In\\nApril of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and Novell\\nseparately announced support for LDAP protocol in their Directory Services\\nproducts in order that they may in turn operate with each other and integrate\\nwith the Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts but at\\nthis time is not finished.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSYSTEM  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Looking for Sound**  \\nSuggested by Corey Hollett\\n\\n[URL]http://www.turtlebeach.com[/URL]  \\n[URL]http://www.3dsoundsurge.com[/URL]\\n\\n_\"I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best sound card and speaker set\\ncombination for 5.1 sound. My criteria were that it be excellent for games,\\nmusic, and dvd playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong point.\"_\\n\\nCorey came to the same conclusion that others have in two respects. Creative\\nhas long maintained a healthy share of the sound card market with a solid name\\nand decent products. Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle\\nBeach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards and at attractive\\nprice points. Corey decided on the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card, a great\\nchoice.\\n\\nHis choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings on the subject. I own\\ntwo Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 2.400 and most recently the ProMedia\\n5.1. The 2.400 system was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me\\nwhen I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the dust. The above\\nreview that Corey pointed out hits the high points, and is actually quite in-\\ndepth for an \"initial\" review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write\\nup a more complete version, as mentioned in the article.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeALERTZ  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Today's Top 5 kbAlertz**\\n\\n  * Q269272 - Mail Client Address List Truncated Using \"Mailto:\" Link If Tag Exceeds 260 Characters (Q269272)\\n  * Q313043 - FIX: Creation of Local Cube Fails (Q313043)\\n  * Q320273 - Subfolders of a Web Folder Are Not Enumerated in the Folders Pane in Windows XP (Q320273)\\n  * Q241210 - Drive List Shows Only Program Drive in 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs (Q241210)\\n  * Q241189 - SNMP Memory Leak in Windows NT4.0 Peer-to-Peer Network (Q241189)\\n\\n**GET HIGH-SPEED ACCESS:** Verizon Online DSL is an affordable, high-speed\\nInternet connection.

MPEG-4\\nisn't the only addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite\\namong professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 5 support and\\nbetter AppleScript functionality also tag along. As always, there is a\\nstandard free version available for download, but the Pro edition adds\\nadditional features, such as full screen video playback, the ability to create\\nMPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free player.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSTUFF  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Microtel & WalMart Love Linux**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.theregister.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nWalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. They were one of the\\nfirst manufacturers to preinstall LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail\\nmarket through WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-\\ninstalled choice in operating systems. These options give potential Linux\\nusers an easier way to get started without having to build their own system\\nfrom scratch or deal with driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall\\ncost. A Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little as $648\\nwith Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter\\nwill continued to be published every Friday\\n\\nWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one\\nis giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in\\norder to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months\\nnow, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little\\ntired.\\n\\nAlso, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or\\nmeet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time\\nto get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.\\nSo it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\\n\\nHaving additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects\\nI've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer\\nElectronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are\\nnailed down.\\n\\nFor now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn\\nout to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer\\nand see how it works.\\n\\nI appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be\\nless frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-\\ndemand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDavid Coursey  \\nExecutive Editor  \\nAnchorDesk\\n\\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Sign up for morefree newsletters from ZDNet**  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![ZDNet]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | Home\\n|eBusiness | Security | Networking | Applications | Platforms | Hardware |\\nCareers | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

Simple.\\nDownload all you want - we'll definitely make more. In fact, we've found a way\\nto get your products and services a little bit of unlimited promotion on the\\nside, too. And who couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless\\nyour data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you get\\nfeatured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls to its knees.\\nWe're still sitting at #5 on Amazon. If we ever hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And,\\nmind you, this hat has been sitting around for quite a while; it smells like\\nfeet. You'd have to eat three sombreros just to get the same amount of\\nnutrition you'd get from my hat. You're better off just going for the free\\nstuff, I suppose. The next time they ask: \"Do you care to Super Size that?\"\\nYou can respond, with dignity: \"My funds are sufficient for the upgrade; I\\navoided spending money on something that would have lasted longer, supported a\\nhelpful cause, and not have killed me earlier.\" It makes sense - if you think\\nabout it. The fries aren't going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the\\nfries, who will?\\n\\nPut your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph I like to\\ncall: \"Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL.\" They went out of their way to\\nsend me an unsolicited e-mail this evening. Now, I know what you're thinking:\\n\"How kind of them, Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in\\nyesterday's issue. They must have read your mind!\" No, they must have rented a\\nlist of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop there. I\\nreceived a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER marketing company. Their\\neffort was indeed caught by this crafty eye, and my money will be diverted to\\nother (less-spammish) businesses in the future. It's my \"direct\" way of\\nsaying: you're not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my\\npatience? I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people from\\naround the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more junk; looks like\\nLycos will never get another click from me, either. See what you get when you\\ntempt fate?\\n\\nMy good buddy, Bill, tells me that Speakeasy.net provides great DSL\\nconnections. He'll even get the credit if I sign up through his affiliate\\nlink! Paul Howes agrees with him, too: \"Static IPs are the norm, they do not\\nuse PPPoE, and they encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection.\\nWhen looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home Services'\\npage. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k upstream, which I have\\nnot seen from any other provider. And that is less than $200 a month, which is\\na bargain when you start looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!\" And\\nStuart Portner is chock full of common sense: \"Remember that a lot of DSL\\nproviders give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at\\nleast for initial setup / shakedown period.\" All the more fries for me, dude!\\n\\nSee You in August,  \\nChris Pirillo  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCONFERENCE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n![Heigh-Ya!]([URL]http://chris.pirillo.com[/URL]  \\n$99 Pre-Registration / $150 At The Door\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeDOWNLOADS  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n|  | **Today's Downloads**  \\n---  \\nAppPlus 3.24  \\nEaseBackup 3.70  \\nHotCrypt 4.12  \\nArles Image Web Pa 4.94  \\nSmasher 2.9.12  \\nThe Bat! 1.61  \\nWinSafe 1.1.2  \\nPrivacy Eraser 1.68  \\nZero Popup 3.0  \\nWinPulse 1.01  \\n  \\n**Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.toteboard.net[/URL]\\n\\n{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the best thing to\\ndo with your money is to invest and then \"forget about it.\" Our Gnomie buddy\\nBrian Stevens is the type of guy that likes to play the stock market.

With Flexible Renamer, I can\\ncut off the \"Shortcut to\" and \"Copy of\" prefixes from all my files, making\\nthem a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even make a .txt\\nfile on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.

You walk into\\ndifferent stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and\\nyou will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be disappointed\\nwhen you go around the corner and pick up your Avengers icons from the comic\\nstore. If all this wasn't good enough then maybe this fact alone will send you\\nto the street of Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This\\nmeans you can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux\\nmachine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities are endless!\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTIP  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\nI just hate it when I try to install a program and the installation fails. I\\nhate it even more when the program doesn't leave a log file to help me track\\ndown the problem. Some would say I am out of luck, but as long as the program\\nuses Windows Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because\\nfor any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging through the\\nRegistry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ Software \\ Policies \\ Microsoft \\\\nWindows \\ Installer. Add a new String value, double-click it, and enter the\\nfollowing Value data: \"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes). These letters can be\\nentered in any order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =\\nStatus messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error messages; w = Non-\\nfatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r = Action-specific records; m = Out-\\nof- memory or fatal exit information; u = User requests; p = Terminal\\nproperties. If you add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add\\nan exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails, I just\\nhave to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log files. They'll vary\\nin name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and end with the .LOG extension. As\\nalways, make sure to backup your registry before making any modifications.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner  and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for \"qmail newbie's guide to relaying\". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

The output is : input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status            of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.

There are already patches for this, look at the Conectiva apt-list archives, you should find them there. Also, apt 0.5 is being actively developed and already contains enough fixes to be compiled on Limbo with gcc 3.2. > In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really > started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added.

You can still use an apt package compiled on Red Hat Linux 7.3 as long as you install the \"rpm404\" package for compatibility. That's what I'm doing currently on my home Rawhide system.

My requirements normally involve better support/easier\\nmaintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a\\ncompany to be behind such an initiative.\\n\\nI imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one\\nweek[1].

So either you can choose to have a \"docs\" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting : %doc docs (or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory) %doc docs/ Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} : %doc docs/* Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not already clear for you. You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be listed when using \"-qd\" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with absolute filenames, for example : %doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual (this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file) Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka %{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc. > Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies? > as for example with gnuboy, all hte docs and the website says is it > needs SDL. >  > Do I set a Requires: SDL >= 1.2 (as my system uses SDL-1.2.4-5) or just > put Requires: SDL. Build the package once and see if it checks for a specific version, or read the installation notes. Often you'll see \"checking for SDL >= 1.2.0\" for example when running configure, then it's best to also make the package depend on that version. > One more quick question, I'm used to compiling source code no problem > (cannot program, but stumble through), whats the best way for finding > out what RPMS are needed for the Requires & BuildRequires macros? > apart from read all the docs and websites info. Well, read the docs indeed :-) You can also compile the package once without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for (basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:) then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those \"Requires:\" and rebuild a final version of the package. Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled, BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel Requires: gnome-libs will be enough since they already depend on the \"lower level\" libs that are glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf. > Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the > best one to ask.
