So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq.

The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003.

The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions.

DESMOND STEVENS\\n\\n                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. \\nYOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. \\nBEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERS MONEY TO \\n A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. \\nAS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE\\n  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. \\nPLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. \\nYOURS FAITHFULLY, \\nDESMOND STEVENS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

Our trademark is our uncanny\\nability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their rebound and\\nupward trend.  Most of the stocks we track rebound and peak within just two\\ndays, giving investors opportunity to make a few bucks back in such a highly\\nvolatile market.  We don't believe the market is such as to take any long-term\\npositions right now.  But in a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities\\nfor short-term stabs (gains) are abundant.  When the question today seems to\\nbe which way is up, we like to think that from the bottom there is no other\\nway---it's all a matter of timing.  \\n  \\nIf you want to receive future Picks **click here**\\n\\nI no longer wish to receive your newsletter **click here**\\n\\nksxqtfdeqfehbhysh\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
