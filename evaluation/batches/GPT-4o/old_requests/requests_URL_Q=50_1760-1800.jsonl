Berman** weighed in this week, arguing that piracy over\\nP2P networks robs songwriters on a massive scale. The congressman from\\nHollywood has authored a bill to stop illegal digital downloads by giving\\ncopyright owners the ability to technologically impair the distribution of\\ncopyrighted works.  \\n**Read Full Story** ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**Spotting a scam in sheep's clothing**  \\nBerman's proposal received a cool reception in Silicon Valley, where rules are\\nfrowned upon and unfettered innovation reigns supreme. So it was that\\nStreamCast CEO **Steve Griffin** spoke for many in the community when he wrote\\nthat Berman's proposal won't work. What's more, he wondered, was Berman really\\nconcerned about controlling piracy, or could the congressman from Hollywood be\\ninfluenced by certain constituents? Conspiracy buffs this week had a field\\nday.  \\n**Read Full Story** ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**How to curb digital piracy**  \\nThe odds that either side will raise the white flag are slim. But must this\\ndebate necessarily turn into an endless donnybrook? Former White House staffer\\n**Jonathan Greenblatt** doesn't buy into historical determinism, and believes\\nHollywood can respond to the challenge of new media. First, it must shy away\\nfrom any legislation that aims to control technology or enforces any\\n\"draconian\" digital rights management rules. What other suggestions does he\\noffer? Read on.  \\n**Read Full Story** ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n  \\n**Writing file sharing's final chapter**  \\nAll this occurs as the P2P community lost one of its brighter lights. Computer\\nscientist and entrepreneur **Gene Kan** died June 29. Kan, who helped to\\ndevelop an early open-source version of Gnutella software, wrote a column for\\nCNET News.com on June 21, drawing on the lessons learned from the history of\\npeer-to-peer technology. In this highly nuanced piece, Kan offers a timely\\nwarning about what can happen when people get overly excited about new\\ntechnologies.  \\n**Read Full Story** ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**CEOs: Are you too focused?**  \\nConventional wisdom has it that \"focus\" is de rigueur for any corporation\\nhoping to achieve superior performance. The flip side of this argument is that\\nmarkets are quick to discount the valuations of diversified companies because\\nof perceived shortcomings. But researchers at McKinsey offer an alternative\\nidea, suggesting that there's a particularly fertile middle ground between\\nfocus and diversification.  \\n**Read Full Story** ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |  \\n  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-cnet-\\nnewsletters@example.com  \\nUnsubscribe | Manage My Subscriptions | FAQ | Advertise\\n\\nPlease send any questions, comments, or concerns to dispatchfeedback@news.com.  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability in prices among products with similar features. It pays to comparison shop for the best price. Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to find the right one for you. We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement to aid your shopping experience. ______________________________________________________________ Featured Products 1) Sound Blaster Extigy 2) Handspring Treo 90 3) KDS Rad-5 15-inch LCD 4) Sony PlayStation 2 ______________________________________________________________ Sound Blaster Extigy sound convergence device The Lowdown: If you're into watching DVDs, listening to tunes, or recording music with your computer, you'd be doing yourself a favor by upgrading your sound with this convergence device.

Draw your own conclusions. Lockergnomie\\nSang Vo writes: \"Though you may have zero liability for a fraudulent\\ntransaction, the paperwork and red tape to work through if someone empties out\\nall your funds can leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards\\nthat now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact your\\ncredit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a plan added to your\\ncard or if you can apply for one that does.\" And Russ Coover continues: \"If\\nyou purchase something with a credit card, and you later decide to dispute the\\npurchase (for a reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses\\nto replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can legally\\ndispute the charge with your credit card company. However, if you use a debit\\ncard to make that purchase, you have no right to dispute the charge.\"\\n\\nJeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in question (E):\\n\"In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if you give your financial\\ninstitution timely notice of the theft of your card or PIN code (two business\\ndays), you are liable for no more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up\\nto $500.\" And Tim Miller extends the translation: \"If someone puts a false\\ncharge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your liability for $50,\\nwith the possibility that your next charge might not go through because the\\nthief used all of your available balance. If a false charge goes against your\\ndebit card and wipes out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can\\nbounce. Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the\\npayees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25 insufficient fund\\nfees - and they are under no obligation to waive those fees. If you have 5\\nchecks outstanding, you could be out over $100.\"\\n\\nFrank Reyes was apparently lucky: \"Someone recently obtained my debit card\\nnumber through a local grocery store. I was told by the checker at the grocery\\nstore that the card readers would only accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was\\nvery suspicious, and used my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's\\ncomputer had been hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several\\nothers)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was reviewing my\\nchecking account online two days later, and noticed an unauthorized charge\\nagainst my account ($60.00). I contacted the vendor that had charged my\\naccount and informed them of the fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the\\nshipment, provided the shipping address to my bank, and credited my account\\nwithin 5 days after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to\\nthe 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact that I had to\\nrequest a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.\"\\n\\nFurther thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: \"I'm not totally sure on\\nthis, but I've been warned against using a debit card for online purchases.\\nYes, you may not be liable for any of the false charges on a debit card (in\\nthe end), but in the meantime (during your dispute) the money will be withheld\\nfrom your account and you will not have access to it. However with a credit\\ncard, you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The scenario I\\nwas given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your debit card and cleaned\\nout your checking account? The money is gone! False charges on a credit card\\nare not \"real money\" until somebody has to pay them. I would guess that each\\nbank has different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call\\nmine and see what I'd face.\" In short, be careful - no matter what you use or\\nwhere you choose to use your plastic.\\n\\nSee You in August,  \\nChris Pirillo  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeDOWNLOADS  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**CYG v20020115 [3.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.geocities.com[/URL]\\n\\n{Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects something.

If the song is a current release or recent, then I do not believe in\\nit. I can't consider it stealing because you can't steal from someone who\\nwillingly puts the file up for downloading. Those who did put the file online\\nmost likely feel that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.\\nHowever, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are attempting to\\nmake their CDs \"rip proof\" either. I do not feel they have the right to\\ndictate what songs I can listen to or when or in what order. I like to rip\\nspecific songs from CDs then make my own CD, which either goes down to my\\nentertainment system or to my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played\\n(\"why\" is explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for my\\ntruck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs stolen, it would\\nbe much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a master. Sometimes, masters\\ncannot be replaced without a large expense, if at all.\\n\\nIf the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not available\\nanywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song being sought is wanted\\nto rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I do believe in that, too. Case in\\npoint: as a kid, I collected a lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than\\n4,000 records in my collection. Many were played so much that they are not\\nplayable anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap\\nstereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to relive some\\nof my younger days through music, but attempting to convert those records (to\\ndigital) is next to impossible for me. So, in this instance, no, I do not\\nthink it is illegal to seek out digitalized copies of the old songs that I\\nalready have records of (albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I\\nam seeking are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD\\nfrom Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.\\n\\nFor those that are impossible to find \"digitals\" for, then, one day, perhaps I\\nwill reach a point with technology (and money) where I can transfer those\\nplatters to WAV and they will sound as good as when they were originally\\nrecorded. I have been lucky enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet;\\nI was quick to purchase the disc, usually from the original artists\\nthemselves. Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I\\nblame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem to care\\nabout the \"lost\" songs when digitally remastered CDs are released.\\n\\nSubmit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!\\n\\n![TechTV's Computer\\nBasics]([URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n**CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS:** If you've got friends or family who want to\\nlearn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check\\nout the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore.

Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: \"I see that you're thinking of getting a\\nDV camera. I got one about a month ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get\\none with A/V INPUTS. Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your\\ndigital stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to get\\nVHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only can you get your\\nold 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can use the camera as a pass-\\nthrough device and get the old stuff directly onto your computer for editing\\npurposes. I wish someone had made clear the advantages and importance of\\ninputs when I bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely\\nmentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But if you're\\ngoing to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you want to work on any of\\nyour old stuff). Don't make the same mistake I did - make SURE you get this\\nfeature. It doesn't seem to impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and\\nsome don't.\" This advice came not a moment too soon for me.

I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that \\nthe run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short \\nloop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 \\nbug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds \\nthem, can you please let me know? Thank you. \\n\\nI ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my \\noff-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of \\nrunners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner \\nsmiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another \\nrunner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative \\nyears. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a \\nrunner. \\n\\nBecoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves \\nrunning. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important \\npart. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, \\nrun around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day \\nyou'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can \\nrun a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, \\nthen get invigorated and run another mile. \\n\\nAnd then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and \\nyou run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and \\nthat the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running \\nthing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and \\nyou run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is \\nimportant too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and \\nrun. \\n\\nThere's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a \\nrunner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you \\nshould really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to \\nmaximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't \\nworry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just \\nanother fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
