[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        From: Mr. Charles Nwodo\\nUniversal Trust Bank.website:[URL]www.utbplc.com[/URL]\\nDear friend,\\nThis letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it.\\n I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that\\n I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment. \\n I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself.\\n Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian\\n National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five \\nHundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\\n  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died \\nin an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.\\n I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank\\n Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.\\n No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government\\n if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into\\n the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary \\ndocuments and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the \\nnecessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer\\n of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this\\n transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com. \\nUpon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. \\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your\\n country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address .Thanks and regards. \\nMr. Charles Nwodo.\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$78M, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing to you.\\n\\nMy name is Bartholomew mutie, I am the personal assistance to the former President of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$78M, on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in\\nNigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later, but resently he has just been arrested and taken away. you can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006. [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n\\nAll the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account.

ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank \\naccounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. \\nThese accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). \\nMost belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in \\nthe discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, \\n1999. \\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe \\ndeposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on \\naccounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts \\ndue non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 20,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was \\ndiscovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit \\nbalance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died \\ninterstate (living no wills). \\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds \\nwithout any hitch.we can share the funds and use in investment of our \\nchoice. \\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me \\nwith your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you. \\nKindly provide me with your full name, address,date of birth and telephone/fax. We will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is \\ntransferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and \\ntransferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total \\namount. \\n\\nYou can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites: \\n[URL]www.swissbankclaims.com[/URL] \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n[URL]www.avotaynu.com[/URL] \\n[URL]www.icheic.org[/URL] \\n[URL]www.livingheirs.com[/URL] \\n[URL]www.wiesenthal.com[/URL] \\nI find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks. \\nThank you for your prompt response. \\nYou can write me in German if you wish\\n\\n\\nYours \\nSincerely \\n\\nAlan Rodriguez\\nPlease reply me under the following \\ne- mail address alanrodriguez90@aim.com\\nPS, please delete this letter if you are not interested\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

I am Ali Raza Khan currently Head of Corporate Affairs Department with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 5th, 2000, a German  business tycoon Mr. Andreas Schranner made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen  to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. The maturity date for this deposit contract was last 3rd of April 2005.  Before this date, I have tried my possible best to locate a Next of Kin to late Mr. Schranner, but all efforts prooved abortive, because all his family, including his Son In-Law and children died in the plane crash of Concorde Air France Flight AF4590 which took place on 25th July 2000, some months after he did the deposit in my bank.  You can read more stories about the plane crash by visiting this website, [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of October this year, the Government will pass a new Financial Control Law which will give the Government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5 million Dollars to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by October the Government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money since he is late.  \\n\\nI decided to utilize this life time opportunity, instead of Government confiscating the, but I cannot directly claim the money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to late Mr. Schranner, coupled with my present position and status in the bank, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the Next of Kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am having the secret Code for the account, which only the account owner of his Next of Kin can know.  \\n\\nI shall supply all necessary information we need for the claim and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  I shall explain to you in details how we shall handle the transaction once I receive your response.  \\n\\nThanking you in advance and May God blesses you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.  I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Schranner when the deposit was made for your perusal.   \\n\\nI wait your urgent response.  \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nAli Raza Khan.  \\n  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Welcome to \"Ghetto\" America!\\n...Yes, you heard me; I said \"Ghetto\" America! What is \"Ghetto\" \\nAmerica, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, \\nthis explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is \\nno less true! \"Ghetto\" America is a society of individuals \\ncomprised primarily of African Americans who represent the \\nimpoverished, and often unpolished side of \"Black America;\" \\nConfused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a \\ntypical ghetto community; namely the \"projects\" and noticed an \\nunusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular \\nneighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have \\nbeen to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young \\n\"teen looking\" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby \\ncarriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also \\nnoticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying \\nthem. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the \\nabsence of the all important \"wedding band\" missing from their \\nrespective ring fingers!\" .And of course we have all heard \\nstories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly \\nmugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know \\nthat many young African American women refuse to date African \\nAmerican males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In \\nfact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who \\nrepresent the subversive side of society; commonly known as \\n\"Thugs\" or \"Street Hustlers;\" Also, did you know that many young \\nAfrican American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while \\nliving in government housing better known as the \"projects\" \\nrather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make \\ninvestments?\\n \\n    \"Attention\" This is Not another \"Boyz in the Hood\" Story!\\n \\nThese newly distinguished \"Black Generation Xers\" are suffering \\nthrough utter chaos. \"Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare \\nAbusers...Images of My America\" is a collection of observations, \\nand commentary as told through the eyes of a young African \\nAmerican Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths \\nthat many in \"Black America,\" and the world in general would have \\nyou believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds \\nlight on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of \\n\"Mainstream American Society.\" A society that has nurtured the \\nrampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many \\nyoung African American men, and women currently suffer from. The \\nwriter supports his arguments with direct references to the \\noverwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to \\nraise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish \\ncriteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes \\nbeing based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or \\ncool neighborhood reputation.\\n \\nThe author also identifies the self-destructive and often \\ncriminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily \\nbasis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, \\nrobbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing \\nexpensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior \\ncommitted by both males, and females is due in large part to a \\nlack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless \\nhomes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with \\nthe unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in \\nthe form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations \\nare the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack \\nof direction that currently exists in young \"Black America\" \\ntoday.
