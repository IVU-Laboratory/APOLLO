I have urgent and very confidential  business proposal \\nfor you.An American Gold consultant/contractor with the burkina  faso west  \\nAfrican Solid Gold Corporation,mr  Morris Thompson made a numbered time \\n(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$10,000,000.00 (TEN \\nMillion Dollars) in my branch.\\n\\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered \\nfrom his contract employers, the west African Solid Gold Corporation that \\nMorris Thompson died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight 261(for more \\ninformation about this crash and person you can contact this website:\\n[URL]http://archives.cnn.com[/URL]\\nsince we got this information about his death. On further investigation, I \\nfound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his \\nnext of kin was fruitless.\\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr  Morris \\nThompson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, \\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. This sum of \\nUS$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the  interest is being \\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever \\ncome forward to claim it.\\nAccording to Laws of Republic OF BURKINA  FASO,  at the expiration of 4 \\n(four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the burkina  faso \\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i am due to \\nretire from office next year 2007,\\n\\nMy proposal is that I will like you tp come in as a next kin/ foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr.Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this \\nold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government \\nofficials.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and \\naddress so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and \\naffidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.through the bank \\nattorney as soon as you put application to the bank.We shall employ the \\nservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL as  the \\nbank will approve you as  the next of kin and to obtain the necessary \\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the \\ntransfer.\\n\\nA bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then \\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. \\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% \\nfor me and 20% for you.then 5%will be map out for any expenses that may \\noccure during transactions.\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be \\ndone by the attorney as will employ him on  the approval of the bank; i am \\nnotifying  you this as a secret of mine, as a senior bank officer.i knew all \\n  what it takes  to get  this funds out of  the bank. and my position and \\nthat of YOU  qarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you \\nare interested, please reply immediately via the private email address \\nabove. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and \\nrelevant application letter  that will help you understand the transaction. \\nPlease send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy \\ncommunication.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this \\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require \\nyour assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply\\nBest Regard.\\nDr.Ouadrago Issak Yamkine,\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Llive Mail Beta ! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

This is by virtue \\nof its nature being utterly confidential and  top secret. We have decided to \\ncontact you due to the urgency  of this  transaction, as we have been reliably \\ninformed of your discretness, trustworthy and ability to carry out legitimate  \\nbusiness.\\n\\nTHE PROPOSITION: An American, Mr. Shaline Adam, an Oil merchant with the \\nFederal Government of  Nigeria, until his death with his whole family on an \\nEgyptAir Flight #990, which  crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31, \\n1999, banked  with us at Pacific International Bank Plc Lagos and had a \\nclosing balance of US$3.5,000,000.00 (Three Milion Five Hundred Thousand \\nUnited States  Dollars Only) as at the end of September, 2000. Attached here   \\nis a CNN webpage on the unfortunate crash in 1999:   \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nValuable efforts have been made by the bank to get in touch  with any of the \\nAdam's family or relative, but to no avail. His Next of Kin was his wife that \\nwas involved in the crash so for now there is no trace of his family.\\n\\nIt is because of the perceived impossibility of locating a relative of the \\nShaline Adam's family (since all his family are dead) that the bank is making \\nplans to ceed the said amount to the Defence Ministry for the procurement of \\nweapons of war. In order to avert this ugly situation, few of my colleagues \\nand I have decided to contact you and seek your   permission to have you stand \\nas a relative to Late Shaline Adam so that the total amount of US$3.5 Million \\nDollars will be processed and released in your favour into your personal \\naccount.\\n\\nAll documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be   carefully \\nworked out.

If you've been like me, you've been trying\\ntrying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel\\n- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise \\nequipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose\\neither. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less\\nweight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Oh geez, not another\\nmiracle diet pill!\" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but \\nmy sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, \\nso I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing \\nto lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was\\nthe best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,\\nas I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds\\nto 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet\\nat all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!\\n\\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer\\nand received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel\\nthe need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it\\ndoes so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.\\nI am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'\\nabsolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!\\n\\nIf you are frustrated with trying other products, without having \\nany success, and just not getting the results you were promised,\\nthen I recommend the only product that worked for me - \\n'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!\\n\\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Ok, so how does this stuff\\nactually work?\"\\n\\nExtreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which \\nis scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid \\nweight loss. No \"hocus pocus\" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! \\n\\nHere is the bottom line ...\\n\\nI can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without\\nexercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. \\nJust try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence \\nto gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my\\npledge to you.\\n\\nBONUS!

Sometimes  \\ncalling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  \\ntalking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  \\nto the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  \\n  \\nWe're here to help!  \\n  \\nWe'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  \\n  \\n**Period.**  \\n  \\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  \\n  \\nWe'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  \\n  \\n_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  \\n  \\n  \\n_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  \\n  \\n_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  \\n  \\n**\\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  \\nSeeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  \\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  \\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  \\n  \\n\\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  \\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  \\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  \\nmaking money from home.  If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!

Sometimes  \\ncalling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  \\ntalking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  \\nto the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  \\n  \\nWe're here to help!  \\n  \\nWe'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  \\n  \\n**Period.**  \\n  \\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  \\n  \\nWe'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  \\n  \\n_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  \\n  \\n  \\n_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  \\n  \\n_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  \\n  \\n**\\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  \\nSeeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  \\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  \\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  \\n  \\n\\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  \\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  \\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  \\nmaking money from home.  If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!
