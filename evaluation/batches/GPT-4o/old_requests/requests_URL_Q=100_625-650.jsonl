As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \\nreally think I'm going to pick this up. \\n\\n    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \\n    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \\n    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \\n    high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \\n    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \\n    time is another story -- more on that later.) \\n\\n    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and \\n    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \\n    hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are \\n    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \\n    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \\n    own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \\n    34-year-old demographic.\" \\n\\nI am that demographic!

The first day's \\nfindings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: \\n\\n    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to \\n    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, \\n    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently \\n    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the \\n    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief \\n    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA \\n    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared \\n    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but \\n    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared \\n    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the \\n    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for \"Hell Freezes \\n    Over,\" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no \\n    more than a 10% \"reserve\" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had \\n    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) \\n    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they \\n    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.musicdish.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The lead singer grabs the microphone. \\n    \"This is Frank Bellknap Long!\" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a \\n    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on \\n    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English \\n    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, \\n    and the guys begin to wail.

Two minutes later, they're done with \\n    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. \"Our next song is about \\n    Harlan Ellison!\" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, \\n    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. \\n\\n    Bldhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle.
