Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct  behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing  list. But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be  the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get  hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense).  If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense).  If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose. Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority,  not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he  should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't  razor provide a razor-blacklist too?) \tJehan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

A quick work-around is to do a \"chmod go+rx\" on that file (of  course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible). In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't  have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later  in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the \"unblessed\"  error.

Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be \\nthe difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but \\nrelated, relaxation techniques including \"betagenics\", \\nhypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I \\nobsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / \\nG-Force Dyno-Staff.\\n\\nI have to say however that, having found this while looking for \\nsomething completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I \\nparticularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the \\nMindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.\\n\\nTo my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular \\nseem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some \\nreligion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very \\nirritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and \\ncontrast with our (my) modern mental models.\\n\\nI found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and \\njustify US/UN foreign policy and actions.\\n\\n[URL]http://mindprod.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://members.aol.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.mindprod.com[/URL]\\n(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)\\n\\nWe create the world we live in.\\nA loving person lives in a loving world,\\nA hostile person lives in a hostile world.\\nEveryone you meet is your mirror.\\n\\nYou make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence \\nas when you give offence.
