Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar \\nwas held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I \\nwas opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of \\nALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan \\naccomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part \\nof the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is \\none of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in \\nthis part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a \\nparticular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that \\nhe buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys \\nto the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find \\nout if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering \\nthe  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market  \\nwhich is affecting his business.\\n\\nBack in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to \\nhandle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and  \\ndiscovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE \\nfor $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & \\nCATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of \\nwhich  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement \\nwith my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each \\nsupply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the \\nreceipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to \\ngive me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its \\nlowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences.\\n\\nHowever, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him  \\nwith 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the \\noppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer \\nof this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will \\npay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me \\nthat he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now \\nwaiting for me to link him to the producer of\\nthe vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell \\nat  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down \\npayment of  50% of our quoted price first.\\n\\nIf you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my \\nbehalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree \\non the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the \\ncontacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI \\nMAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI \\nNURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and \\nwe  should never allow him to know the\\ncontact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal \\ndirectly with them.\\n\\nThanks for your cooperation.\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMR KONAN ALAIN\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

How would you like \\nto generate more income through a different avenue? What \\nif it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another \\nprogram, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. \\nThere \\nis NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!\\n\\nTHE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW\\nTHOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH \\nYOU \\nIS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!\\n\\nHere's something which (I trust) will be of interest\\nto you! Please read all of this. This is not something \\nthat I would normally look at, except that I read an \\narticle in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about \\nPayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it \\nwould work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had\\nalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. \\nYou can complete this whole process in one hour and you \\nwill never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! \\nDid I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the \\nInternet-type fast.' Everything is done on the\\nInternet by E-mail.\\n\\nNEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from\\nindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a \\nlittle of their time.\\n\\nTESTIMONIALS FROM:\\n\\nTony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:\\nHey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of\\nour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 \\ngrand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run \\nthis program again........\\n\\nMary Gathers, Columbia, SC:\\nHey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to\\nyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said \\nand went on vacation. When I got back, my account was \\nup to over $12,000! I owe you!\\n\\nGETTING STARTED.\\n\\nIf you're not already a user, the very first thing you\\nneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes \\nand PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this \\nprogram FREE!\\n\\nHere's the link:\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\nBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO \\n$100 \\nDOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!\\n\\nThen...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) \\nto the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note\\nlike \"Please add me to your mailing list.\" BE PREPARED TO GET\\nEXCITED.... YOU \\nWON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the \\nothers \\nto start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No \\nprinting, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US \\nPostal and \\nLottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, \\nSection 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal \\nRegulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a \\nproduct or service must be exchanged for money received). \\n\\nHere's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this \\nTHREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much\\nfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY \\nHIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see \\nresults in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT \\nMONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 \\nor more as in other programs). Ideally, you should\\nsend them to people who send their programs to you or to \\npersonal contacts who are already working on the web, \\nbecause they know these programs work and they are already \\nbelievers in the system! Besides, this program is \\nMUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already \\nin \\nanother program, stay with it, but do\\nyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! \\n\\nIt's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long \\nbefore others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE \\nperson a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET \\nWHEN \\nYOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have \\na \\nPayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 \\nGIFT \\nto\\nthe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list \\nat No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow \\nthe simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 \\nin your bank account!\\n\\nBecause of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT \\nPOTENTIAL, \\nthis program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 \\ntransaction that you get from PayPal!!!\\n\\nFollow These Simple Instructions: \\n\\nE-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST \\nname on the list (No.1) along with a note saying \\n\"subscribe me to your mailing list\". Only the first \\nperson on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. \\n\\nEdit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the \\nother \\ntwo names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first \\nplace \\nin order to earn money fast! \\nIf you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-\\nmail to then your name will be immediately removed\\nfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if \\nyou add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of \\npeople receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! \\n\\nNOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in \\nthe body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. \\nSend out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.\\n\\nALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the \\nresponse \\ntime is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! \\n\\nConsider this! Millions of people surf the Internet\\neveryday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people \\nto start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move \\nthe other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own \\ne-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is \\nassociated \\nwith your PayPal account.\\n\\n*************************************\\n\\n1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com\\n\\n2.  tomk4@prodigy.net\\n\\n3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com \\n\\n*************************************\\n\\nThere are fifty thousand new people who get on the\\nInternet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses \\nis the people who send you offers by email.\\nThe source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to\\nthink of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I \\nsay 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's \\nso easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!\\nTo send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE\\nand paste it in the message of your E-mail. \\n\\nTO DO THIS:\\n1. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and \"select all\"\\n2. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and select \"copy\"\\n3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure\\nit's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)\\n4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box\\n5. Go to \"edit\" and \"paste\" (Then you can format it\\nanyway you want!)\\n\\n\\nNow you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the\\ntop name, adding your name and address to the bottom \\nof the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, \\nYOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT \\nforget \\nto send $5.00 via PayPal (along \\nwith your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL\\naddress before deleting it!\\n\\nNOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in\\nthis e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal \\nreferring URL;\\n\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.\\nWhen your name reaches the first position in a few\\ndays, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!\\nThe money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people\\nlike yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to \\nreceive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a \\ntotal of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) \\nin two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is \\nreal money that you can spend on anything you wish!\\nJust deposit it to your own bank account or spend it \\ndirectly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that \\neasy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?\\n\\nGO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4\\nTHOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?\\n\\nIF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF\\nCOURSE YOU CAN---\\n\\nThis plan is structured for everyone to send only 20\\nletters each. However, you are certainly not limited \\nto 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters \\nyou send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can \\nE-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! \\nTHE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run \\nthis \\nprogram, just follow steps 1\\nthrough 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! \\nSimple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no \\nmailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the \\nprinter or copier, and you can do it again and again \\nwith your regular groups or gift givers, or start up \\na new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the \\nlist. This is proof that you paid to get put on the \\nlist which is the service rendered to make all this \\nlegal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive \\nan MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will \\nclimb to the number one position at dizzying rates. \\nFollow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE \\nPLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. \\nYour name must run the full gamut on the list to produce \\nthe end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list \\nWILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats \\nthe other people who have worked hard and have earned the \\nright to be there. So please, play by the rules and the \\n$$$ will come to you!\\n$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will \\nprosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, \\nespecially with all the different programs out there \\non the web, but if you don't try this you will \\nnever know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!\\nI've been watching this type of program for years and\\nthis is about as easy and fast as you can get it and \\nit can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, \\nno envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort \\nand faith!!! This program really \"Keeps It Short and Simple\"! \\n\\nOH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link \\nunder your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...\\nso they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when \\nsomeone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! \\nLet's all make some serious money \\n$$$$$$\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO BEGIN:\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\nPlay by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your\\ntime, and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS.\\n\\n\\nFOLLOWING ARE SOME NOTES ABOUT PayPal WHICH YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL:PayPal \\nlets \\nyou pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online \\npayment \\nservice - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands \\nand \\nthousands of online shops. You can also use PayPal to \\npay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to \\nsplit the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in \\ncollege,or \\nsend cash to someone in another country. Better yet, you can also \\nearn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and \\ncompletes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! \\nWhen \\nyou send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your \\ncredit \\ncard or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, \\nbecause \\nPayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with \\nPayPal \\nis more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to \\na \\nstranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use \\nPayPal \\nto move money.\\nSigning up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only\\na couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus \\nrequirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your \\naccount balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the \\nweb site at\\n\\n[URL]https://www.paypal.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"Best of the Web\" -Forbes\\n\"Using the service is actually safer than a check or\\nmoney order\"- Wall Street Journal\\n\\n\\n\"PayPal can play a major role in your life. You can\\nuse it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle \\ndinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to \\nrepay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- Time\\n\\n\\nPS. Does this sound too good? Well maybe to some skeptics it\\nis. But it actually works, and is worth \\nthe few minutes of your time now. \\nP.S.S.

I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25 going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor. Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical. Not only are you making money from your own business, you're helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital. Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN): ================================================== Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money. Their findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only $25 in startup costs.\" DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU WILL MAKE. This is what one had to say: \"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed. Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars rolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back. Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find $580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week. Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?\" Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: \"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I felt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other $25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back. As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled my $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and that's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already up $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped. On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.\" Greg Moran, Boston, MA.

BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME IN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS DOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.**** As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM! These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture, you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT [URL]http://www.cashbynet.net[/URL] to plug in your own numbers and see the results. METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports. Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you. $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. **ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET: Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole proprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a program for everybody.  If you are just a passer by, and don't have a personal vision of success, delete this now.  Life all comes down to a few opportunities - this is one of them. Have the courage to be free, and have the drive to reach your goals.  Before you start working with us, take 10 minutes and write down your personal goals.  What do you want in 5 years? 1 year? 6 months? Be realistic - set your goals high enough so you will work hard to reach them. Remember: You are the owner of your own destiny, make these goals become reality - only you know what needs to be done. You now possess the ideas, information, materials, and opportunity to become financially independent and reach your highest dreams.  I hope you come along for the ride, it's a wonderful world ahead.

I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in\\nAfrican developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist\\nsearch.\\n\\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability\\nand reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God\\nor Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15\\nmillion U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account\\nthat belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire\\nfamily in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got\\ninformation about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to\\ncome over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody\\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in\\nour banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed\\nnext of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving\\nnobody behind for the claim.\\n\\n It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my\\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety\\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u0092t\\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that\\n30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the\\nprovision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses\\nincured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman\\ncolleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement\\naccording to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon\\nas you receive this letter.

I am (Prince\u00a0 Hassan Esq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search. When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  \u00a0 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. \u00a0 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.  \u00a0 You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your\u2019s faithfully,  Prince\u00a0 Hassan\u00a0 (Esq.) \u00a0 POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

There is an account opened in this bank in 1999 and since \\n2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old \\nfiles in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out \\nurgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. \\nMorris Thompson, a foreigner, Business Man and a miner at Kruger Gold \\nCompany, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000. Ever then no \\nother person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has \\nno other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this \\ncompany does not know anything about this account and the money involved is \\nOne hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 136 Million).  \\nI want\\nus to first transfer US$ 36 Million from this money into your safe\\noverseas account before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner \\nbecause this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be \\napproved to any foreign account because the money is in United States \\nDollars and the former owner Mr. Morris Thompson is a foreigner too. I know \\nthat this message will come to you as surprise as we don\ufffdt know ourselves \\nbefore.\\n\\nWe will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine\\nbusiness. You can view the web site bellow for more information on our late \\nclient.\\n\\n[URL]http://archives.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nI only got your contact information from my secretary who operates\\ncomputer; with believe in God that you will never let me down in this \\nbusiness, considering my position as a public servant. You are the only \\nperson that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so \\nthat I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your \\nprivate telephone and fax numbers including the full details of your account \\nto be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face-to-face and sign a \\nbinding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money \\ninto your account where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your \\ncountry for withdrawal and sharing and other investment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner \\nwith foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation \\nto make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this \\npayment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which \\nI will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate with \\nme, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust \\naccording to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because this \\nopportunity may never come again in my life. I need a truthful and God \\nfearing person in this business because I don\ufffdt want to make a mistake so I \\nneed your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I don\ufffdt\\nwant anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should make \\nsecrecy and confidentiality our primary working condition, bearing in mind \\nthat I am a public servant. I will also use my position and influence to \\neffect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account \\nwith appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange \\ndepartment.\\n\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be giving 25% of the total\\namount, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred the process of the transfer.

Here in\\nNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute\\nwith years of outstanding service to the people of\\nAfrica.\\n\\nI have resolved to contact you through this medium\\nbased on business proposal that will be of mutual\\nbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars through\\na consultant company base on my research for a\\ntrustworthy and established person that understands\\ninvestment ethic for entering into a life time\\nprofitable joint partnership investment and also\\nco-operation with confidence and trust that you will\\nkeep the contents secret and divulged to any third\\nparty.\\n\\nTo be explicit and straight to the point. Some time\\nearly 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited a\\nconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.\\nAnd since then our client has failed to come forward\\nto claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.\\n\\nConsequently, in our bide to contact this client to\\nredeem the demurrage which his consignment had\\naccumulated we discovered that our client was the\\nformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who\\ndied of illness after he was de-throwed in the same\\nyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.\\n\\nSince the death of our client President Mobutou\\nSeseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to\\nclaim the consignment with us, which means that non of\\nhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of this\\nconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to\\nsecretly open the two boxes that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the\\ntwo boxes that were registered as treasure! r by our\\nclient actually contained a considerable amount of\\nmoney in United States Dollars amounting to about\\nUS$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have\\nbeen nursing plans secretly. I also found out from\\nenquiries and the foreign media that our late client\\nsiphoned a lot of money from his country while he was\\nin office as head of state.\\n\\nIt is my conviction that the consignment in our vault\\nwas part of the money that our client siphoned and now\\nthat he is dead there is no race to this money in our\\ncare.\\n\\nI am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me\\nin transferring this money out of nigeria to your\\ncountry for immediate investment with your assistance.\\nI have also decided that you will generously be\\nentitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt\\nof your reply confirming your willingness to assist me\\nof this transaction, I will immediately arrange and\\ntransfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to\\nyour name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the\\n\\ncomplete funds to your\\ncountry.\\n\\nyou have nothing to worry about, as I will be there\\nto assist you in anyway necessary with all proper\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free.\\n\\nPlease maintain absolute confidentiality on this\\nmatter.\\n\\nPlease reply to the above email address with your\\ntelephone and fax so that i can call you.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nYours faithfully.\\nMR.VICTOR KOVIS\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nsent by Excite Inbox - [URL]http://inbox.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\npowered by Excite UK - [URL]http://www.excite.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    "}]}}

I am (PATRICE KONE  Esq),The Head of file Department in \\nAfrican developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.\\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and \\nreliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or \\nAllah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 \\nmillion U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that \\nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \\nin (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about \\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his \\nmoney because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but \\nunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died \\nalongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department \\nnow decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to \\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \\ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to \\ngo into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline \\nhere stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the \\nmoney will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The \\nrequest of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as \\nforeign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will \\nbe set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for \\nme and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the \\nimmediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to \\nthe bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank \\nname, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for \\neasy and effective communication and location where the money will be \\nremitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the \\ntext of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nPATRICE KONE (Esq.)\\n\\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to \\nmove very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you \\nfinished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very \\nwell over this business.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________\\n\\nJe suis le directeur du bureau de changes  la BAD-burkina.

C'est afin \\nd'viter que ce fond profite au gouvernement burkinab que mon collgue et\\nmoi avons dcid de chercher un partenaire tranger qui peu nous aider  \\nfaire transfrer cette somme dans son compte bancaire. Ceci dit, vous devrez \\nvous prsenter au niveau de la banque comme hritier du dfunt afin de \\ndevenir bnficiaire de ce fond.

THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL \\nREQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN \\nWITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN \\nACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS \\nREQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE \\nCORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM \\nTO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.\\n\\n\\nI WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON \\nSMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE \\nTOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF \\nEXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE AND \\nINTERNET BILLS, WHILE 50% WILL BE FOR ME.

He assured me of your capability and releability to champion this\\nbusiness opportunity.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten \\nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a \\nplane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \\nrelease it unless\\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here \\nstipulates that if such money\\nremained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the \\nbank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in \\nthis business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in \\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location\\nwherein the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \\nmore explanations.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR ALI IBRAHIM..\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWindows Live Messenger sur i-mode : dialoguez avec vos amis depuis votre \\nmobile comme sur PC !

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nFROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO.AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT.BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE,LOME- TOGO. \\n \\nDear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard. \\n \\nI have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia. \\n \\n>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M). \\n \\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. \\n \\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. \\n \\nMay I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner. \\n \\nPlease, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. \\n \\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.\\n Yours Sincerely, Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nInvite your mail contacts to join your friends list with Windows Live Spaces.

My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.\\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assetsto my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul.So I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will\\nwant you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set\\naside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: mr4rezaabdulla@walla.com\\n \\n \\nGod be with you.\\nRegards,\\nMR.

MICHAEL BUNDU of the\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \\nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \\nhis soul rest in peace. \\n\\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \\ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \\nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \\nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \\nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \\nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \\n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\n\\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \\nas the beneficiary. \\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \\nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \\nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \\n\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \\n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \\nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\\nthe information We gathered from an associate \\nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \\nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \\ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \\n\\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \\nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \\nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \\naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\\ninformation to enable us discuss the \\nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\n\\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \\nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \\nus. \\n\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \\nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\\nThank you and God Bless. \\nBest Regards \\n\\n\\nCOL.
