We are making\\na large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will\\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\\n\\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\\ncan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send\\nan email, you can do this.  No special \"skills\" are required.\\n\\nHow much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \\ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\\nand rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if\\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\\njust the thing you are looking for.\\n\\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,\\nthere are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -\\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\\neach month also).\\n\\nInterested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a\\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\\ndecide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still\\nhave that \"burning desire\" to find an opportunity that will reward\\nthem incredibly well, if they work at it.\\n\\nTo grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the \\n web address [URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL]  and send me an email with following \\n information\\n\\n\"Send me a free membership!\"\\n\\nBe sure to include your:\\n1. First name\\n2. Last name\\n3. Email address (if different from above)\\n\\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\\nas soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.\\n\\nIf you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)\\nyou are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,\\nVery Cheap ISP package and many many more,\\n\\nYou can also go to the web address:\\n[URL]http://club.4tfox.com[/URL]\\n\\nThat's all there's to it.\\n\\nWe'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\\n\\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nHugh Zou\\n\\nP.S. After having several negative experiences with network\\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\\nThis is different - there is value, integrity, and a\\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\\nand finally make real money on the internet.\\n\\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\\nprogram for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free\\nmembership.\\n\\nUnsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with\\n\"Remove\" in the subject line.

I have urgent and very confidential  business proposal \\nfor you.An American Gold consultant/contractor with the burkina  faso west  \\nAfrican Solid Gold Corporation,mr  Morris Thompson made a numbered time \\n(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$10,000,000.00 (TEN \\nMillion Dollars) in my branch.\\n\\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered \\nfrom his contract employers, the west African Solid Gold Corporation that \\nMorris Thompson died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight 261(for more \\ninformation about this crash and person you can contact this website:\\n[URL]http://archives.cnn.com[/URL]\\nsince we got this information about his death. On further investigation, I \\nfound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his \\nnext of kin was fruitless.\\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr  Morris \\nThompson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, \\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. This sum of \\nUS$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the  interest is being \\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever \\ncome forward to claim it.\\nAccording to Laws of Republic OF BURKINA  FASO,  at the expiration of 4 \\n(four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the burkina  faso \\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i am due to \\nretire from office next year 2007,\\n\\nMy proposal is that I will like you tp come in as a next kin/ foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr.Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this \\nold man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government \\nofficials.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and \\naddress so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and \\naffidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.through the bank \\nattorney as soon as you put application to the bank.We shall employ the \\nservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL as  the \\nbank will approve you as  the next of kin and to obtain the necessary \\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the \\ntransfer.\\n\\nA bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then \\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. \\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% \\nfor me and 20% for you.then 5%will be map out for any expenses that may \\noccure during transactions.\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be \\ndone by the attorney as will employ him on  the approval of the bank; i am \\nnotifying  you this as a secret of mine, as a senior bank officer.i knew all \\n  what it takes  to get  this funds out of  the bank. and my position and \\nthat of YOU  qarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you \\nare interested, please reply immediately via the private email address \\nabove. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and \\nrelevant application letter  that will help you understand the transaction. \\nPlease send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy \\ncommunication.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this \\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require \\nyour assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply\\nBest Regard.\\nDr.Ouadrago Issak Yamkine,\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Llive Mail Beta ! \\n[URL]http://www.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This is by virtue \\nof its nature being utterly confidential and  top secret. We have decided to \\ncontact you due to the urgency  of this  transaction, as we have been reliably \\ninformed of your discretness, trustworthy and ability to carry out legitimate  \\nbusiness.\\n\\nTHE PROPOSITION: An American, Mr. Shaline Adam, an Oil merchant with the \\nFederal Government of  Nigeria, until his death with his whole family on an \\nEgyptAir Flight #990, which  crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31, \\n1999, banked  with us at Pacific International Bank Plc Lagos and had a \\nclosing balance of US$3.5,000,000.00 (Three Milion Five Hundred Thousand \\nUnited States  Dollars Only) as at the end of September, 2000. Attached here   \\nis a CNN webpage on the unfortunate crash in 1999:   \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nValuable efforts have been made by the bank to get in touch  with any of the \\nAdam's family or relative, but to no avail. His Next of Kin was his wife that \\nwas involved in the crash so for now there is no trace of his family.\\n\\nIt is because of the perceived impossibility of locating a relative of the \\nShaline Adam's family (since all his family are dead) that the bank is making \\nplans to ceed the said amount to the Defence Ministry for the procurement of \\nweapons of war. In order to avert this ugly situation, few of my colleagues \\nand I have decided to contact you and seek your   permission to have you stand \\nas a relative to Late Shaline Adam so that the total amount of US$3.5 Million \\nDollars will be processed and released in your favour into your personal \\naccount.\\n\\nAll documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be   carefully \\nworked out. We have secured from the probate, an   order of Madamus, to locate \\nany of the deceased beneficiary.   Be rest assured that this transaction is \\nrisk-free. Also, your share for offering to assist us and provide the \\nreceiving account will be 10% of the total sum, while 90% will be for my \\ncolleagues and I, which also would be in your account for safe custody and \\nprobable future investment purpose in your country.\\n\\nAs soon as we receive an acknowledgement of your willingness    to accept our \\nproposal, we shall furnish you with further details as we concluded all \\narrangements to have the money transferred to you within 7 working days from \\nthe date of commencement.\\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable to you, then furnish us with your most \\nconfidential telephone and fax numbers  at which   time an application for the \\nfund release will be forwarded in your favour.\\n\\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nAjibola James\\n\\nAlternative mail:jrade2000@caramail.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 100, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

If you've been like me, you've been trying\\ntrying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel\\n- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise \\nequipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose\\neither. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less\\nweight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.\\n\\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Oh geez, not another\\nmiracle diet pill!\" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but \\nmy sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, \\nso I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing \\nto lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was\\nthe best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,\\nas I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds\\nto 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet\\nat all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!\\n\\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer\\nand received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel\\nthe need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it\\ndoes so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.\\nI am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'\\nabsolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!\\n\\nIf you are frustrated with trying other products, without having \\nany success, and just not getting the results you were promised,\\nthen I recommend the only product that worked for me - \\n'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!\\n\\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Ok, so how does this stuff\\nactually work?\"\\n\\nExtreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which \\nis scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid \\nweight loss. No \"hocus pocus\" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! \\n\\nHere is the bottom line ...\\n\\nI can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without\\nexercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. \\nJust try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence \\nto gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my\\npledge to you.\\n\\nBONUS!
