I am writing following the impressive \\ninformation about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm \\nin my country. He assured me of your capability and reliability to champion \\nthis businees opportunity.\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30m US dollars ( Thirty \\nmillion US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family in november 2001 in a plane \\ncrash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \\nsupposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane \\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \\nthis businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after six years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by \\nthe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as \\nnext of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \\nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in \\nthe money will be remitted .\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction  is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of \\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .\\n\\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDR ALI IBRAHIM.\\nBill and Exchange Manager,\\nAfrican Development Bank ADB .\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Your information was given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Federal Government delegation on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a\\nconfidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described\\nhere under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business\\nWithin the Department of Minerals an Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue\\npayment in US funds.\\n The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign\\ncontracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$14.500,000.00Dollars.Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.\\n Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign government and non-government agencies, we include our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa. We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.\\n  I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$3.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$9.425m  (65%) and the balance of US$1.450m (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incurred.\\n The business itself is 100% safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favor of You/your Company. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

I \\nwrote to you last \\ntime no response and I decided to write you again. \\n\\nI am Mr.Nze Moore from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the \\ncourse of our \\nauditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) floating in an \\naccount opened \\nin this Bank since 1996 and as from 1999 nobody has \\noperated on this account \\nagain, and after going through some old files in the \\nrecords I discovered \\nthat the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE] on oct \\n31 1999 by \\nplane crash, Egyptair flight 990, \\n([URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] the \\nmoney is \\nfloating. \\nAfter due verification I noticed that no other person knows \\nabout this \\naccount except his wife who \\nwas also invovled in the crash, and the account has no \\nother beneficiary and \\nmy investigation proved to me as well that until his death \\nhe was the \\nDirector GOLD ARK [SARL] \\n\\nSince our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information \\nabout his death, we \\nhave been expecting his next of kin to come forward and \\nclaim his money \\nbecause we cannot release it unless somebody \\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nas indicated in \\nour banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody \\ncame up to this \\nbank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon \\nthis discovery \\nthat I and other officials in my department now decided to \\nmake this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as \\nthe next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \\ndisbursement since nobody \\nis coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the \\nBank treasury as \\nunclaimed Bill. \\n\\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be \\nused as the next \\nof kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the \\ncountry law here does \\nnot allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the \\nmoney will be \\nrecalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this \\nperiod. \\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the \\napplication form, \\nbank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail \\nto bring to your \\nnotice that this business is hitch free and that you should \\nnot \\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can \\nbe finalized \\nwithin five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a \\nrelation to the \\ndeceased. \\n\\nWhen you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail \\nsignifying your \\ndecision.Including your private \\nTel/Fax numbers for quick communication. I will be very \\nhappy if you can \\ntreat this business with the \\nutmost secrecy it demands because of my position in this \\nbank. \\nHoping for a very successful business relationship with \\nyou. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n\\nMr Nze Moore.

First Atlantic Bank PLC 4/6 Adetokunbo Ademola Street P. O. Box 75369 Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria website:  I Am Mr.nelson mba, in charge of bills and foreign exchange remittance Department of First Atlantic Bank Plc. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered an unclaimed sum of $24.5Million (Twenty-four million five hundred thousand dollars) in an account belonging to one of our customer,(Mr.Kurt Kahle. Age 51) who died in a plane crash (Concorde Airlines Flight AF4590)with his 37-year-old wife and son Michael, aged eight. on Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK Please view this site and read it's content carefully. [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money. Unfortunately,neither the family nor the relation has appeared to claim this money. We cannot release this money unless somebody applies as the next of kin or relation to the deceased. Our banking guidelines indicated that if such money remained unclaimed for a period of Six (6) years, it would be transferred into the First Atlantic Bank Treasury as unclaimed fund. Another officer and I in the department now decided to transfer this money into your account as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for easy collection since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go back into the bank treasury as an unclaimed fund. Infact it is my friend that advised me to urgently arrange to transfer out this money through another foreign beneficiary outside the country.Upon your acceptance to this proposal,we have also agreed on a sharing Ration: 1.30% for you as the account owner 2.60% for I and my colleagues 3.10% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both locally and internationally during the cause of this transaction. Furthermore we shall be coming over to your country when the money is finanlly in your account and we shall be relying on your advise as regards,to investment of our share,be informed that this transaction is genuine and 100% risk free considering the top level bank officials involved. As you know that I enjoy good office here with the bank and I will use my personality to make the official application on your behalf for approval of this money into your nominated account thereby having the banktransfer this money into your bank account. I will advice that you furnish me with the necessary details for me to make the official application of claim on your behalf as the next of kin and beneficiary of this money with out wasting time Here are the details I will need to make the application.

I am the son of Dr. David\\nCarlos who was recently murdered in the land dispute in\\nZimbabwe. I got your contact through Network on line in my\\nsearch for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very\\n\\nConfidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund\\nto a foreign account and I decided to write you, My Late\\nFather was among the few Black Zimbabwean Rich Farmers\\nmurdered in Cold Blood by the agents of the ruling\\ngovernment of President Robert Mugabe for his alleged\\nsupport and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party\\ncontrolled by the white minority. \\n\\nBefore his death he had taken to Johannesburg - South\\nAfrica to deposit the sum of US$ 18.5 Million (Eighteen\\nMillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with\\nSecurity and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming\\ndanger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a Box as \\nValuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security\\nCompany. This money was embarked from the purchase of New\\nMachinery and Chemical for Farms and the establishment of\\nnew farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. \\n\\nThis land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe\\nintroduced a new land act that wholly affected the Rich\\nWhite Farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the\\n\"Modus Operandi\" adopted by the government.  This resulted\\nto rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and\\nsome political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-one (31)\\npeople have so far been killed. Heads of governments from\\nthe west, especially Britain and United States of America\\nhave voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan.\\nSubsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C)\\nhas continuously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is\\nagainst this background that I and my family who are\\ncurrently residing in South Africa have decided  to\\ntransfer my Father's money into a Foreign Account. \\n\\nAs the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the\\nresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where\\nthis money could be transferred without the knowledge of my\\ngovernment who are tactically freezing our family wealth\\nand South Africa's government seems to be playing along\\nwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this\\nmoney in South Africa for fear of encountering the same\\nexperience in future since both countries have almost the\\nsame political history. More so, the South African Foreign\\nExchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are\\nseeking for an \"ASYLUM\".\\n\\nAs a businessperson whom I entrusted my future and that of\\nmy family into his hands, I must let you know that this\\ntransaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your\\nbusiness does not necessarily matter. For your assistance,\\nwe are offering you 30% of the total sum, 60% for Me and My\\nFamily while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may\\nincurs during the course of this transaction. We wish to\\ninvest our part of the money on commercial property based\\non your advice.\\n\\n\\nFinally, all we demand from you is assurance that you will\\nnot sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal\\nor company's account in your country. If this proposal is\\nacceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the\\nabove TEL and or E-MAIL me.\\n\\nThanks and God Bless you.\\n\\nBest Regards.\\nJohn Carlos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________________\\nHerbalife Independent Distributor [URL]http://www.healthiest.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"AUT\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

Christian Eich ,Who died alongside with his entire family on \\nMonday,  31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in paris.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next  \\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  \\nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt\\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\n  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and my colleagues decided to make \\n  this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\n  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank  \\ntreasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  \\nunclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the bank  \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  \\nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your designated \\nbank account ,you must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin \\nof the deceased with a text of application that we will send to you, so we  \\nwill like you to send to us your private telephone , fax number  for easy \\nand effective communication and location where the money\\nwill be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, we will send to you by fax or email the text of  \\nthe application . we will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I got your information from a personal search in the\\ninternet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential \\nco-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of\\nall \\nparties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of\\nthis business.\\nWithin the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work\\nas a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation\\nof four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue\\npayment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage\\nof the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a\\nforeign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced\\nto the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred\\nThousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost\\nhas been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance \\nunclaimed. \\n\\nSince the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign\\ncontractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations\\nwith foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.\\nAs a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation\\nof some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve\\nBank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as\\nthe beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed\\nto operate a foreign account. \\n\\nI have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,\\nshould you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share\\nas compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and\\nthe balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.\\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does contract\\nprojects of the nature described here. The assumption is that\\nyour company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other\\ncompanies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms\\nof unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more\\nspecialized firms for execution. \\n\\nI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not\\ndisappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my\\n e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this\\ndeal. If\\nyou are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner\\nto carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners\\nand myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim\\npossible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and\\nguarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that\\nyou treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form\\nof exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active\\nGovernment Service. \\n\\nAlso your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful\\nexecution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in\\nyou and hope that you will not disappoint us. \\n\\nKindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance\\nof this proposal. \\n\\nRegards, \\n\\nEngr.Makalele Johnson\\n\\n\\n================================================== \\nSingle?

But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one \\nof his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We \\nimmediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in \\nCongo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being \\nthreatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi \\nKaresava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other \\nMilitary Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In \\nview of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist \\nus to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.\\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a \\nsecurity company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the \\nDiplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through \\nnormal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who \\nsuddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President \\nKabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor \\nmet each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in \\nyour country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, \\nthis transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge \\nsuccess within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires \\na total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund \\nout of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your \\ntelephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the \\nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost \\nindulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your \\nDecision, while I await your prompt response.

The present Government of\\nGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my\\nfamily in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is\\ndead.\\n\\nThey have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.\\nUnfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National\\nAssembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The\\nlaw they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to\\nfrustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for\\nmy family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was\\njailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat\\nagainst his administration in 1995.\\n\\n\\nThis highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some\\nWestern Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from\\nus a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the\\nWorld. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to\\nthe barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized\\nout of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This\\nassertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to\\nconfirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from\\ntheir website at [URL]www.thisdayonline.com[/URL] from the archives section in the\\nMarch 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.\\n\\nThis pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever\\nowe.

This is a call for you to help receive this money and\\nput the money into good investments since we are barred from\\nleaving the Country for now.\\n\\nAccording to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we\\nstill have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we\\nintend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to\\nhandle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.\\n\\nPlease Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the\\nsecurity company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall\\ngive you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage\\naccrued over time payable to Security Company to enable\\ncollection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the\\ntime of Deposit has since expired.

ICEP is charged with the responsibility \\nof finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss \\nindigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\n\\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\nWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\n\\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\n\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established.\\n\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\n\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing \\ncredit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by \\nthe law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died \\ninterstate (living no wills).\\n\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds and \\nwe can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.\\n\\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your \\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim \\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you.\\n\\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I \\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a \\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the Cayman Island, of which you \\nwill be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to \\nyour country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 \\npercent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO \\nRISK INVOLVED.\\n\\nYou can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the \\ninternet at the following websites:\\n\\n[URL]www.swissbankclaims.com[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n[URL]www.avotaynu.com[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]www.icheic.org[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]www.livingheirs.com[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]www.wiesenthal.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nThe Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting \\nsubmission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.\\n\\nI find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a \\ngreat opportunity for a life time of success without risks.\\n\\nDue to security reasons, reply to my via email only. You may reply to \\nme securely on the following email,\\njohnson1313@sify.com\\nThank you for your prompt response.\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
