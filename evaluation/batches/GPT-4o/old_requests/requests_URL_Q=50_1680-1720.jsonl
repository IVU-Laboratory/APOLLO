I'm not sure if it was ever used with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to remove the log statements once running. I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone. After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a very good job.

By integrating the advanced\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\\n\\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\\n\\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\\n  essential.\\n\\n  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\\n  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be\\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\\n\\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\\n  \"present.\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\\n  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\\n\\n  \"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\" says\\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. \"The powerful combination\\n  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist\\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\"\\n\\n  \"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\\n  training, support and product design,\" says David Farrington, vice president\\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \"By integrating the\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\"\\n\\n  About Magi\\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\\n  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\\n  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can\\n  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and\\n  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work\\n  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming\\n  unsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent\\n  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as\\n  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical\\n  interface, and universal name spaces generating \"follow me URLs\" for mobile\\n  professionals.\\n\\n  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.\\n  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing\\n  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,\\n  [URL]www.tadpole.com[/URL], which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad\\n  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.\\n\\nI did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my \\nfiles were in the way.\\n\\nThen I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to \\nfetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At \\n339M that took almost 3 hours.\\n\\nNow I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D \\npatches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in \\nthe process. \\n\\nThink I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a \\nnew box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full \\nday to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. \\nkdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for \\nthe computer running 'round the clock this week.

Last week, search requests\\nfor information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on\\nproducts and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space,\\nmany credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than\\nmusic, according to Wired News.  \\n---|---  \\n**2** | **Macworld:**  \\nThe annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not\\nSteve Jobs has anything real to announce. So far, it looks like Apple has\\nalready surprised a few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No.\\n7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire.  \\n**3** | **PayPal:**  \\nIt's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and PayPal deal. Soon after eBay\\nannounced it was buying PayPal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit\\nclaiming that PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being\\nsubpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its involvement with\\nonline gambling transactions.  \\n**4** | **Wi-Fi:**  \\nI'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the Buzz Meter\\npermanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact\\nbetween tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon\\nCommunications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public\\nareas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports.  \\n**5** | **eMac:**  \\nThis is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that\\nApple released it to them. The CNET review is out, and here's the word: the\\neMac is what the iMac used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly\\ninexpensive computer for users who don't need to do much besides word\\nprocessing and accessing the Web.  \\nFor more Buzz, click here.  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage my subscriptions  | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN 8.0.

One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this\\nbothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature\\ncameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But\\nwhat does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my\\nprivacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this\\ninteresting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing\\nthese miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them.\\nSo if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about\\nthis, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting\\ncaught on camera in an embarrassing situation.  \\n  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\nLee Koo  \\nCNET Community  \\nGot suggestions?

Whether\\nyou are looking for your dream job or trying to hire talented people, the\\nfull-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your IT\\ntalent solution today!  \\n---  \\n  \\nI've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project.\\nApparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers\\nvolunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. Linux\\nusers, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to\\nspend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a\\ngood cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations\\nthat might be in need of such skills. And, I've seen some very interesting\\nsuggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of\\nthe above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though.\\nkeep the subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and\\nsort through my email system.\\n\\nIt looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.\\nAccording to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee\\non its previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an\\nOS 10.2 upgrade at $129.\\n\\nI won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how\\ndifficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years.\\nRevenues, by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s\\nand early 2000\\. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income,\\nsome of which were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch\\nin the past few years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the\\nnewsletters will remain free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative\\nincome sources.\\n\\nOn a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According\\nto their most recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest\\nin the company's history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue.\\nThat doesn't put them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the\\nstrong quarter will only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much\\nof this revenue was the result of the Mandrake Linux User's Club.\\n\\nThe news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest\\npartnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded\\ncomputers for sale on WalMart.com. I would never have guessed that WalMart\\nwould lead the consumer Linux machine charge. They've had Mandrake boxes\\navailable for several months. Now, with the addition of both Lindows and\\nMandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail\\ncomputer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.\\n\\nHave a great Wednesday.\\n\\nTony Steidler-Dennison  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTWEAK  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Lockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!** Are you\\nlooking for the ultimate computing resource?

While I use a combination of fetchmail,\\nprocmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong\\ncontender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the\\nKDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.\\n\\nThere's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't\\nautomatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much\\ntime as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the\\nadditional step to check your email after opening the program would be an\\nirritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and\\nsimple configuration issue.\\n\\nTo force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon\\nin your KDE panel. Select \"Preferences\" and the \"Execute\" tab. In the Execute\\nwindow, change the command line to read:\\n\\n    kmail --check -caption \"%c\" %i %m\\n\\nThe addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail\\nwhen you open the program.\\n\\nFewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part XIII**\\n\\nAs you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for\\nnetworking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed\\nto stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It\\nshould come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux\\nkernel configuration is dense with details and options.\\n\\nI will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections\\nof the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock\\nconfiguration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.\\nYou're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be\\nused and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and\\nexternal). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.\\n\\nFor security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:\\n\\nThe Linux Security Quickstart HowTo  \\n  covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel\\nconfiguration issues\\n\\nLinux Network Security from Linux Planet  \\n  a nice tutorial on network security\\n\\nNetwork Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4  \\n  other approaches to network security\\n\\nThese should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your\\nLinux kernel.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**PyMP3Cut**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.librelogiciel.com[/URL]\\n\\n\"PyMP3Cut is a Python commandline tool designed to cut huge (> 100MB) MP3\\nfiles at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time\\nusually needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to\\nmore easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything.

That\\nserver is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the\\nyanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the\\nswitch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message\\nlike every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS\\ndevelopers.

I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a\\nminute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I\\nwanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an\\nalternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of\\nyou using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and\\nthe word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in\\ndrinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized\\nHTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in\\ntheir new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another\\nfiltering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript\\nfunctions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeSTUFF  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Yer Kidding... Really?**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.theregus.com[/URL]\\n\\nI'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us that have had to\\nmanage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software,\\nmaintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's\\ncertainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server\\nwith less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and\\nmaybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very\\nlong last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point\\nout that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true.\\nBut at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like\\nfunctions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained\\nstaff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional\\ntraining, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it\\ncomes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use\\nWindows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. Cheap is in\\nthe budget of the beholder.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Tonight, a handful of Bay\\nGnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore. Melanie, Steve,\\nBrent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and Mindy had a total blast.\\nWell, it wasn't much fun when Robert got his digital camera confiscated - but\\nthis was a show worthy of five megapixels (believe me)! Brent went to the show\\nlast night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this afternoon. They were\\nselling a new CD (which had JUST been released the other day); \"They Got Lost\"\\nis full of a few previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about\\npurchasing it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic\\naccount and download a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the\\nopening act: Noe Venable. She's got a few free MP3s on her site, too. Give\\n\"Boots\" a shot - very nice.\\n\\nDoes anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me as a gift\\n(which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the manual - but the ones\\nand zeros start to look eerily similar after flipping past the first page. You\\nknow me: I'm not much of a math guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day\\nthat 'byte' was short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'\\nrepresented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece, but it just\\nisn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that? I'm ready to walk on the\\nwild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've\\nbeen known to do nutty things on a moment's notice, like changing my default\\nWeb browser. Courtesy of Asa Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD,\\nand t-shirt (which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too\\njealous; Mozilla.org has plenty of goodies to go around.\\n\\nLooks as though Jake and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis. They're\\nat the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds of well-known\\nprogram programmers - the people who make our computers work the way we want\\nthem to work! We're doing our best to convince them to join us at Gnomedex.\\nThey ask: \"Who else is going to be there?\" We answer: \"People who don't know\\nyou yet.\" They ask: \"Then why should I come?\" We answer: \"Because it's a\\nbusiness opportunity for you.\" They ask: \"What if I don't want to learn\\nanything or meet anybody?\" We answer: \"We can't really help you there, but\\nhere - have lunch on us.\" They ask: \"Oh, the admission price includes food at\\nat Gnomedex?\" We answer: \"We cannot provide every meal, but you won't go\\nhungry.\" They ask: \"So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there.\" We\\nanswer: \"You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.\" Get\\nit? Got it?

However, sometimes a simple text\\nmessage just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of\\nGigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a\\nWAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program,\\nor use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the\\nhabit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too\\nlong on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The\\nauthor says, \"This program is essentially free to use for non-profit\\npurposes...

Lucky for me, Context\\nThumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view\\nan image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose \"View Thumbnail,\" and\\nthere is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open\\nup any programs! \"As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always\\nready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window,\\nincluding Open and Save As... dialog boxes.\" As an added bonus, with Context\\nThumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I\\nwant to save system resources.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCLICKS  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n![TECHNOLOGY can be frustrating for new and intermediate computer users, UNTIL\\nNOW.

Don't run all over\\nyour machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when\\nyou can do it all (and more!) with Starter.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWILDCARD  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15**  \\nUnearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin\\n\\n[URL]http://www.aversoft.com[/URL]\\n\\n{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident?

Alex writes: \"Did you know that you can\\ncopy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?\" Alex also\\nhad this to say: \"When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a\\nnew location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from\\nthe old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse\\nbutton to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right\\nmouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text\\n(along with several other options).\" Those are some great time saving tips\\nAlex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X\\nto cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then\\njust text!

I know that Jake, Chris and\\nRandy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and\\nI'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in\\nthe words of many industry insiders, \"The show of the year.\" It was unlike any\\nother computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've\\nattended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a\\nhuge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all\\nabout - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts,\\nand learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No\\nhassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find\\na better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of\\nluminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet\\nfor computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I\\nreally do hope to see you there.\\n\\nAnother Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores.\\nThat's right. Jake has release a **FREE** GnomeTome on \"Converting Vinyl LPs\\nto CD.\" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well,\\nmy age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't\\nknow if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead\\n- \"Gnome\" our servers. Get you copy while you can.

You can use\\nit equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been\\nsomething of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a\\nbrowser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question -\\nit's a web browser and a web broswer only.\\n\\nRegardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror\\nbrowser and end up in your /home/ _user_ directory. Have no fear, though. It's\\nan easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.\\n\\nOpen Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select \"Configure\\nKonqueror,\" and leave the default selection of \"File Manager\" as is. In the\\ntext box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the \"Home URL\"\\ntext box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the\\nhome URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home\\npage. Select OK to close the window.\\n\\nTaking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser\\nto open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select \"Window\" and \"Save\\nView Profile, 'Web Browsing.'\" This will futher save the URL and allow your\\nthe opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.\\n\\nKonqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it\\nact like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part XII**\\n\\nDepending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for \"Redundant Array of\\nIndependent Discs\" or \"Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs.\" No matter. They\\nboth point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy.\\nThat's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.\\n\\nLet's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple\\ndiscs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally,\\nthere are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and\\nRAID-5.\\n\\nLinear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In\\nother words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no\\nredundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further,\\nthere's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one\\ndrive in the RAID array at a time.\\n\\nRAID-0 \"stripes\" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the\\nfirst drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no\\nredundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives,\\nnot all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0\\nwill, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.\\n\\nRAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, _does_ provide data redundancy. This is the\\nfirst level in which data is \"mirrored\" across the drives in the RAID array.\\nAll data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at\\nleast two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall\\nRAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can\\nactually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is\\nwritten across multiple discs.\\n\\nRAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity\\ninformation while striping the data across the others. This is much like\\nLinear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data\\n_can_ be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but\\nthis really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is\\nprobably the least used of the RAID schemes.\\n\\nRAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed.\\nLike RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than\\nreserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the\\narray. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can\\nbe accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a \"spare disc\" configuration\\nwill allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after\\nthe failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5\\nis probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.\\n\\nWith all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel\\nconfiguration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to\\nconfigure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel\\nconfiguration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the\\nRAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate\\noption.\\n\\nTomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**SaveMyModem**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://web.genie.it[/URL]\\n\\n\"SaveMyModem is an anti-spam, mail-shaping, and delete-on-server mail tool.

The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter\\nwill continued to be published every Friday\\n\\nWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one\\nis giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in\\norder to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months\\nnow, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little\\ntired.\\n\\nAlso, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or\\nmeet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time\\nto get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.\\nSo it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\\n\\nHaving additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects\\nI've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer\\nElectronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are\\nnailed down.\\n\\nFor now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn\\nout to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer\\nand see how it works.\\n\\nI appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be\\nless frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-\\ndemand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDavid Coursey  \\nExecutive Editor  \\nAnchorDesk\\n\\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Sign up for morefree newsletters from ZDNet**  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![ZDNet]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | Home\\n|eBusiness | Security | Networking | Applications | Platforms | Hardware |\\nCareers | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit  This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like \"%makeinstall\" or \"make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}\" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the unpacking and building processes.

I still disagree with the  reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions  that I'm on the losing end of :) The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I  don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching  the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is  patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when  I get a chance.

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's  not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with  full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local  use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above  technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for  everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This  just makes it a little bit faster. gary _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I've a site on http://ip:8080/mysite.  I want that to appear as [URL]http://mysite.com[/URL] - so:         ServerName mysite.com         DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite         RewriteEngine                   on         RewriteRule     ^/(.*)    http://localhost:8080/mysite/$1 [P]  Now, what happens is that apache grabs http://localhost:8080/mysite/ and spits it out to the browser. Lovely. all works.  Except for framed pages (like Zope's management interface). It ends up looking like:       and of course, that's not what my client should go to. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong ?
