I've always been under the impression that\\nthe uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's\\nlong-standing \"10:00 A.M. policy\", in place until the decision in 1963 to\\nswitch over to \"let-it-burn\".\\n\\nThe 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from\\nEurope, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a\\npolicy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they\\ndirectly threatened property.\\n\\n40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff\\nleft to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement\\nforests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. \\n\\nI would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors\\nsquarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes\\nupon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of\\nmaterials, location, and landscaping.\\n\\n-- \\nnjl\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It was one of the worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200 crew members survived. Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic story a startling new twist. It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made the sinking possible. Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58 surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And, they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds. Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six torpedoes sent it to the bottom. \"It was sheer chance,\" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. \"Without that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the cruiser, especially at that distance.\" With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a university honors course called \"Astronomy in Art, History and Literature.\" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the moon in military and other encounters. Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright star in van Gogh's \"White House at Night.\" He and some students went to Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was completed in June 1890. Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed, and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then identified the \"star.\" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June had occupied that part of the sky. A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the middle of the month that year. Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the opening of \"Hamlet,\" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the \"star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns.\" From the guards' description, the season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars. Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star, for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia, creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the source of some of his best-known plays. Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other astronomy-based sleuthing. Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic \"Moon and Half Dome.\" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at 4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960. Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of \"Moon and the Half Dome\" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual moon and the Half Dome. Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly rapid movement of the moon described in \"The Merchant's Tale\" occurred in April 1389. And in \"The Franklin's Tale,\" Chaucer's description of the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur astronomer. Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride, how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that, while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat. Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining \"the tide that failed\" in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943. Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with drafts of at least four feet, to pass. But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, \"the ocean just sat there,\" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600 yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun fire from the Japanese. Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the military planners were aware that they had to contend with a \"neap\" tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes water levels to deviate less. But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed and the marines in trouble. \"I'm not in the least blaming the planners,\" Dr. Olson said, explaining that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been applied to the waters at Tarawa. Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, \"We can calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.\" Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. \"I have thought about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,\" he says, \"and that has made my life as a scientist much richer.\" [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov  ----- From: Vladimir Katalov  Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov  Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 [URL]http://news.com.com[/URL] By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PT WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system. In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it \"could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years\" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system. HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books. If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that \"is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection\" of copyrighted works. On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias \"Phased,\" said in the message: \"Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.\" That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Now, I desperately need some games, especially TuxKart and FlightGear, but I  forever get stuck on a dependency: everything needs OpenGL. Querying the rpm  database for OpenGL gets me nowhere fast. Can anyone point me in the right  direction? What, in RedHat, provides OpenGL? Sorry for the question, but I've just switched from SuSE and I'm used to being  able to tell YaST to sort out the dependencies........

As a Mets fan since 1962, I\\nthink it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing.

I\\ntotally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money.\\nThe site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major\\nLeague Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for\\nfree to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over\\nby MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves\\nbased on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another\\nside to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please\\nremember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this\\nwebsite is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.\\n![]([URL]http://www.scripting.com[/URL]  \\n  \\nPostscript: I've been emailing with Bryan, and asked if the local NY press has\\ntaken up his cause.
