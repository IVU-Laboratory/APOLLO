The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who \"forgot\" to _leave off_ the leading '%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4. Confused? Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what I found \"documented\" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes: Line 46: \t- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only. Line 49: \t- bail on %files macro. Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro? Line 172-174: \t- add \"rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)\" to track \t    %post -p \"/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib\" \t  incompatibilities. I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:   1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If      you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:      error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib   2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later. > --  > On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me >        A badly configured newsreader >  > _______________________________________________ > RPM-List mailing list  > [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL] >  _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It's\\ncompletely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to\\nsee. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for\\nthemselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.\\n\\nContrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to\\ndetermine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point\\nsomething becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\"\\n\\nThe unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly\\nineffective filter at this point.

It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced mature sperm when grafted in mice. \"It might work for primates or even humans,\" claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study.  If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy their ability to make sperm. Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to mature and produce sperm. Infectious particles  The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer remission.  But the grafting approach \"would eliminate any possibility of passing cancer cells back to the patient,\" says reproductive biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University. However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some scientists wary of the idea. \"I would very much hesitate to say that it's something we should be doing,\" says reproductive biologist Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School. Castrated mice  In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or pig sperm. When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen for several weeks. Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. \"We think that's a very real application,\" she says. She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new contraceptives on human sperm production.

Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning. Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already. I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program.

John Cusack and Tim Robbins make this comedy\\nwork, starring as the two security guards as they send up all sorts of\\nHollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh at the ridiculous predicaments\\nthese two survive, as they are greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and\\nmovie industry names. I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list\\nthis movie on a resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of\\nthem, especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each\\nother. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's underground\\nclassics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant to those out there who\\nare looking to put it to the man. If you've ever hated the recording industry\\nand its in-crowd attitude, you'll love this film. A closing reference to\\nRene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa Monica, which is a regular stop for me every\\ntime I'm in the LA area, prompted me to want to watch the film for a second\\nviewing. The movie is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really\\ngrabs attention on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one\\nwill buy it anyway.\\n\\n  * Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only) \\n  * Color, Closed Captioned, Widescreen \\n  * Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1 (English) \\n  * Audio Commentary - Bill Fishman - Director, Michael Nesmith - Executive Producer, Catherine Hardwicke - Production Designer \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWALLPAPER  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**A N N I H I L A T I O N forAbstract** by prelude  \\n![](images/blank.gif) Posted on 7/11/02 2:15PM --  \\n\\n![Abstract by\\nprelude]([URL]http://www.deskmod.com[/URL]\\n\\n[Download]  \\-- [Zoom]  \\-- [Visit DeskMod]\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]  \\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Know that whether\\nyou answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring\\nand compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found\\nfrom among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the\\noutcome.\\n\\nSecond, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader\\nbrought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case,\\noffering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That\\ncertainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that\\nstarted with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd\\nexpect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that\\nalready - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see\\nthe potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on\\nthe subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority\\nof which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're\\nmoving on.\\n\\nOn to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, CleverMedia is\\nsponsoring karaoke night at Gnomedex. According to the woman with her finger\\non the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, \"There is definitely a 'surprise' in\\nthe works for the attendees ... \" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's\\nMiss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at\\nCleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun --\\nit's what they do for a living! Between Leo Laporte, Doc Searls, Steve Gibson,\\nMark Thompson, Evan Williams, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly\\nto miss out.\\n\\nOnward.

CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot\\nwith their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply,\\nthe fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project. Using this slick little\\napp, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully\\nfunctional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running\\nWindows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice\\ncubes in the blasted lands.\\n\\nLet's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver\\nOffice and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install\\nscript. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to\\nbe launched individually from a shared window.\\n\\nI started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD\\ndrive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd\\nexpect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always\\nhave, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a\\nWindows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.\\n\\nEven Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver\\nOffice package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of\\nthe install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I\\nwas just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell\\nwhether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.\\n\\nFor the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE\\ninstall was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to\\ncustomize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull\\ntogether legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup.\\nEven printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\"\\ndriver.\\n\\nLet me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project\\nwalk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always\\nsuspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the\\nfinancial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well\\nfounded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a\\nlevel of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the\\nspectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these\\nproducts could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows\\nusers to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't\\nneed to fear those losses any more.\\n\\nA note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you\\nwell know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a\\ncase in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply\\nwasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs\\ntheir minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems\\nto be the perfect pay model for Linux.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeTWEAK\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCORE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**Kernel Configuration - Part X**\\n\\nToday we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux\\nkernel configuration.\\n\\nThere's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question,\\n\"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have\\nall the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If\\nyou're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead\\nof PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other\\nhand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be\\nfilled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.\\n\\nSee, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the\\nhigh points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion\\nof PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the\\nconfiguration has been pretty straightforward.\\n\\nTomorrow, we _will_ dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device\\nkernel configuration.\\n\\nRecommend It!  \\nSend us a GnomeCORE tip\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeFILE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**LiquidWar**\\n\\n  \\n[URL]http://www.ufoot.org[/URL]\\n\\n\"Liquid War is a truly original multiplayer wargame.

Twenty-five bucks wasn't steep, but the principle of\\npaying for a former freebie was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though;\\nsurprising myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd rather\\ndish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.\\n\\nThat's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that most of us\\nhave gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail accounts, most \"free\" Web\\ne-mailers have started charging for premium services or imposing strict\\nlimitations on free accounts. Read our reviews of the four top services to see\\nwhat you get if you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you\\nwant to stay spam-free.\\n\\nSurfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app. The latest\\nversion of the popular file-sharing software BearShare now offers a paid\\nversion that lets you search and download without those annoying ads. Maybe\\nthe best things in life are now those with a fee.  \\n  \\n  \\n---|---|---  \\n---  \\n![This Week's Buzz Meter]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| WorldCom woes continue  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![Crucial Clicks]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | **Next-generation MP3 players**  \\nThese three hard drive-based MP3 players turn last year's models into\\npaperweights.  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n\u0095 Mojo rising: TDK's new MP3 CD player  \\n\u0095 The Nomad Jukebox 3 breaks new ground  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |  | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Most popular**  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n**MP3 & audio**  \\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n1\\.

Now entering its fourth week as front-page news,\\nWorldCom woes continue to sap investor confidence. This week's big story: the\\ntop execs from the company are standing silent against government accusations\\nof wrongdoing.  \\n---|---  \\n**2** | **BearShare 4.0:**  \\nThis new version of the well-known peer-to-peer software was been completely\\nredesigned and comes in two flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This\\nis nice touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area: downloading\\nmusic. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's tests, it had an abysmal\\nsuccess rate at actually returning files.  \\n**3** | **Jaguar:**  \\nWho ever heard of an operating system release being early? Well, Apple is\\nmanaging to pull off the impossible; it intends to ship an update to OS X in\\nAugust, instead of the anticipated late fall time frame.  \\n**4** | **Warcraft III:**  \\nAh, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and sit in front of your computer.\\nWarcraft III has just been released--right in time for the good weather.\\nGameSpot calls it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it\\nfor you, there's another fighting game on deck (see No. 5).  \\n**5** | **America's Army:**  \\nAs Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army\\nwants _you_ to play PC games. That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3\\nmillion developing its own title, and it has just launched a television\\ncampaign to drum up interest.

In an advisory posted\\nWednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said\\nthey had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D\\nhandhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system,\\ngiving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be\\ninput through the keypad or touch screen.  \\nJuly 11, 2002, 12:50 PM PT  |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n**Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in**  \\nA widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users\\nencrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and\\nleft the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security\\nissued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good\\nPrivacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on\\ncould let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network\\nAssociates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.  \\nJuly 11, 2002, 11:05 AM PT |  **Read Full Story**\\n![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]\\n\\n  \\n**ACLU: Don't rat out your customers**  \\nA clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers\\nto get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous\\ncritics.

Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message\\nBoards. The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to\\ngiving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the\\nBoards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life\\nexperiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common\\ninterest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky\\nexecs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or\\nquestion in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.  \\n  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\nLee Koo  \\nCNET Community  \\nGot suggestions?
