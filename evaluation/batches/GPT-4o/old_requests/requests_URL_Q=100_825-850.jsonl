My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \\nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \\nother things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \\n10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \\nconvinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it \\nall without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll \\nbe back this afternoon. \\n\\nMy email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \\nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \\n\\nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \\nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \\nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \\nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \\nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \\nvocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so \\ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \\n\\nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \\nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \\ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \\ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \\nquestions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in \\nmy RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file \\nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \\nfeed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \\nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \\ndictionary.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.peerfear.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Well, he seems to think so. \\n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \\nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \\n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \\naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \\nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. \\n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is \\nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \\nusers.&#8221; \\n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \\nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \\n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to \\nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \\ngive it more stability.

And you knwo they are great lovers those french are. A\\npsychology professor decided to study the way in which different people\\nfrom different parts of Europe have sex with sheep. He traveled first to\\nWales, where he asks a farmer to explain his method: \"Well, boyo, I put\\nher back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves,\\nand we're well away. Tidy!\"  The professor tries Scotland next \"Hoots an'\\ntoots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with\\nme velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!\"  The professor\\nmoves on to Germany: \"Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her\\nwith my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a\\npattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his\\ninvestigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and\\nasks him to explain the French method: \"Well monsieur, I put her back legs\\ndown my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and\\nthat's all there is to it!\" The professor is excited to have found some\\nnational variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods\\nof the Scots, Welsh and Germans. \"How do they do it then?\" asks Pierre,\\nand the professor explains. Pierre on hearing the explanation walks of\\ndisgusted. \"What! No kissing?\"\\n\\nFrenchie>Voil.

However improbable it seemed at\\nthe time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the\\n.ie zonefile.

Set in the old west.\\n\\nA cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly \\nsurrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians \\ntake the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the \\ntribe deals with their victims:\\nEach day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to \\ngrant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible \\nslow death. Time for your first wish.\\n\\nThe cowboy thinks a bit, and says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" So the \\nindians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the \\nhorse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a \\nbeautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, \\nappropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.\\n\\nThe next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at \\nyesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says \"I want to \\ntalk to my horse\". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in \\nits ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes \\nback, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy \\nand the women go in the tent, ..., etc.\\n\\nOn the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are \\neager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, \\nand the cowboy again says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" The horse is \\nbrought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, \\nstares right at him, and says -- \"Read my lips -- Posse!
