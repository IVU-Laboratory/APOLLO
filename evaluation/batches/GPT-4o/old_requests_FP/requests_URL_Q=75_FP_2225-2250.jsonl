Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to an European private bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president.

My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time.On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me.\\nThe reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will facilitate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.Upon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have been finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business.Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.Regards, Mr Adams   Swll\\nAfrican Development BankOuagadougou, Burkina Faso. \\n \\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFind a local pizza place, movie theater, and more\u2026.then map the best route!\\n[URL]http://maps.live.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\nIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\nAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\nnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. \\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. \\n\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 50,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills). \\n\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the U.A.E Dubia, being a tax free country, where we can safely withdrew the funds and we can share the funds and use  it for investment of our choice. \\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your \\ndetails for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim \\ndocuments for transfer of the funds to you. \\nKindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I \\nwill pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a \\nsecure, numbered account in your name in the U.A.E Bank in Dubia, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of  your choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED. \\n\\nYou can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the \\ninternet at the following websites: \\n[URL]www.swissbankclaims.com[/URL] \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n\\n[URL]www.avotaynu.com[/URL] \\n[URL]www.icheic.org[/URL] \\n[URL]www.livingheirs.com[/URL] \\n[URL]www.wiesenthal.com[/URL] \\n\\nThe Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting \\nsubmission of valid claims for necessary disbursement. \\nI find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a \\ngreat opportunity for a life time of success without risks. \\nDue to security reasons, reply to my via email only.

Dear Sir/Madam, Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and if it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this channel.  I am AUDITOR EDWARD CHIEF AUDITOR MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC.I got your information when I was searching for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and lists in the web site.I wish to transfer the sum of $14,300,000.00 USD (FourteenMillion Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account.  This fund was a residue of the over invoiced Industrial Contract bills awarded by MINISTRIE OFFINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC to some foreign firms.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the chief auditor,I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary. It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region.  The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance andpartnership in your country.  I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum ascompensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings.  NAME OF YOUR BANK....................................ADDRESS OF THE BANK..................................ACCOUNT NUMBER.......................................BENEFICIARY\u0092S NAME...................................TEL/FAX NUMBERS OF THE BANK..........................COUNTRY OF BANK......................................YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER.............................YOUR AGE.............................................OCCUPATION........................................... Upon the receipt of this informations,the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay.As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefullyand lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved.  Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:- 1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00. 2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00. 3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.

I am Barrister Kenneth Obi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folded as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from June 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insurance Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Life policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.\\nIn 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not terminate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  for cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a letter from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for further discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Three Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chairman of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they asked me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.\\nSince 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I went back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and senile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to get any of  the Chairman\u2019s relative with his authorization to claim the surrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bearing same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surrender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money would be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I feel it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use some percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.\\nI contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the money if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect and regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to whoever I present to them as heir to the Chairman.
