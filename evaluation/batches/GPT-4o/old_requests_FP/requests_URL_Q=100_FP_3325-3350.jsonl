Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:\\n\\nI. Background:\\nShengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. ([URL]http://www.sinopec.com[/URL], as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. \\n\\nII. About us\\nShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff. The factory mainly produces oilfield special equipment such as beam unit, Spiral-seam submerged-arc weldedsteel pipe, sucker rod, line pipe, casing, tubing, plastic compound pipe etc. It produces 200,000 tons of line pipes, 1 million meters of strengthened plastic compound pipes, 500 beam units, 2.5 million meters of sucker rods, 12,000 tons of PP gas pipes and 50,000 tons of oil tubings yearly, and has become important pipe base in Shandong and Shengli Oilfield. Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.\\nThe Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.\\n\\nIII. Content of the project\\nIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from114 to 339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.\\n\\nIV. Product specifications\\nFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7\\nFor delivery: grade of steel are X52X60X70, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7.\\n\\nV. Economic Analysis\\nThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.\\nThe break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.\\n\\nVI. Plans for cooperation\\nWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:\\na. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35\\nb. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30\\nc. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10\\nd. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25\\n\\nTo meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.\\nWe would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.\\nFor additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt reply.\\n\\nSincerely yours, \\n\\nTony Leung\\nProject officer\\n\\nTel: +86-546-833 9362\\nFax:+86-546-832 9817\\nMobile: +86-133 4505 3225\\nEmail: tony@mpbdy.com\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"JPN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand \\nUnited States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your \\nimpressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole \\narrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the \\ndeceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign \\naccount has been put in place and directives and needed information will be \\nrelayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to \\nassist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues.

I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand \\nUnited States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your \\nimpressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole \\narrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the \\ndeceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign \\naccount has been put in place and directives and needed information will be \\nrelayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to \\nassist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in.

In my department we discovered an \\nabandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US \\ndollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. \\nANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire \\nfamily in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash \\nyou can visit this site: [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless \\nsome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this \\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that \\nthe money can be  release to you as the next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for \\nit and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed \\ndormant fund.\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a \\nforeigner and a Burkinabe like me  can not stand as next of kin to a \\nforeigner.\\nI agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \\nduring the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your \\ncountry for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to \\nenable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply \\nfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a \\ntext of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the \\ntext of application form,I will like you to send me the following \\ninformations.\\n1. NAME IN FULL:................................\\n2. ADDRESS:.......................................\\n3. NATIONALITY:...................................\\n4.

MARITAL STATUS:..................................\\n8. PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................\\n9. PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................\\nso i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective \\ncommunication,also location where the money will be remitted.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application form.\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free \\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \\narrangements have been made for the transfer.

My name is \\nDr.Hilary Colsman, solicitor to the great Yengeni family in South Africa.\\nRecently, my client's wife Mrs. Susan Yengeni took my attention to the \\nwide use of her husband's name by some impersonators/Scam artist to defraud \\nforeigners, claiming to be related to the family. Incase you had received such \\nemail before now, from anyone else, please ignore the email and desist from \\nit now. She also revealed to me about her husband's funds that is been \\ndeposited in a bank in my country.\\nFor your information: Her husband, Mr. Tony Yengeni was arrested and \\ncharged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud, which was \\npolitically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament \\nin South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party. \\nWe had pleaded guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges \\nbut were later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank \\naccounts in my bank and abroad being frozen.\\nNow, as a matter of urgency, we need your assistance in the remittance \\nof the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a \\nbank in South Africa, which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your \\nfavorable response and consent in this deal.\\nThe amount is US$22.5 Million United States Dollars, which was deposited \\nby Mr. Tony Yengeni before his arrest. At the moment, the account is on \\nDormancy, because no one has been operating the said account since his arrest. \\nAll the account details and documents where also brought to me by his wife. \\nI hope you understand.\\nYou can find more about her husband?s predicaments at the following \\nwebsites:\\n[URL]http://www.polity.org.za[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.go.za[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.hsf.org.za[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.hinduonnet.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za[/URL]\\n[URL]http://www.ifp.org.za[/URL]\\n\\nLet me assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.

GODWIN AKWESI TEL: +233 208216645 FAX: +233 27621073 Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation;  and //[URL]www.nativefederation.org[/URL] The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together, so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response. You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.
