This \\nweek, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda \\nreally entails: \\n\\n    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another \\n    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to \\n    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that \\n    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't \\n    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants \\n    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used \\n    to violate copyrights. \\n\\n    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the \\n    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask \\n    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep \\n    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing \\n    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a \\n    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after \\n    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some \\n    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. \\n    Saying it doesn't make it so.  \\n\\nLink[2] Discuss[3]\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL]\\n[3] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: \\n\\n    The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for \\n    celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in \\n    which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that \\n    itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that \\n    the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of \\n    the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by \\n    Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model \\n    derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, \\n    were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the \\n    second century AD.) \\n\\n    A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus \\n    does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been \\n    built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the \\n    three other planets known at the timeMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other \\n    words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known \\n    celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, \\n    using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the \\n    zodiac running round its edge.  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Mark!_)\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.economist.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.quicktopic.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
