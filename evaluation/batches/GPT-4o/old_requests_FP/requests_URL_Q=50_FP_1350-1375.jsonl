Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You\\ndraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take\\nabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully\\nlistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts\\nand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of\\nthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to\\nimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.\"\\n\\nWorks!  There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle\\nfinger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found\\nthe boundary, and repeated the motion.

IANAHNBARHE -- RHL 8.0 is fully python-2, with a back compatability v 1 shim set.  This has been working and freely available in their Raw Hide for 5 months for early adopters and back-porters. Red Hat maintains binary compatability across major releases.   Its server management tools are heavily Python, and becoming  more so.

He did confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue. A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts. If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP if that will provide better performance.

Internap has been aware of these problems since approx 06:00 PST.  Most of the problems appear to be concentrated on the East Coast but we have reports of problems from other geographic regions. This is being tracked under Internap ticket 106448 and UUnet master ticket 651751. UUnet currently does not have any ETA for a fix for this event. If you have issues reaching a specific site please send an email to noc@internap.com with a traceroute showing the path which has a problem.

All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the\\nwebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some\\nmore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)\\nbut all in all a smooth move.\\n\\n\\nNow the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of\\nfunky things going on in the walls and in the area.

That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between\\nthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting\\n11mbs and at least 60% goodness.\\n\\n\\nSome cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works\\ninthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a\\nmicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear\\ncat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad\\nthing?
