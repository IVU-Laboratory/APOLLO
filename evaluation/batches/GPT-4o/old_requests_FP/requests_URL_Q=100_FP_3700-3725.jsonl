[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hello,\\nI am Mr. Usman Ramat Shehu, Manager with UNITED BANK FOR AFRICAN PLC(U.B.A.).I have a confidential business proposition for you. Our Bank is a \\nfinancial institution specialising in private banking to individual customers who likes confidentiality in their financial dealings.I have intrest of investing in your company as such i would like to make contact with you for assistance.\\nOn January 13,1987 an Indian-American mining consultant with the \\nPetrogas Gas Systems BV Environmental Systems, Mr. Dixit Shanti made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty Four calendar months, valued at \\nUS$49,500,000.00 (Forty Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in the Bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \\ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie \\nflight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he \\ndied intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his \\nnext-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see\\n[URL]http://www.geocities.com[/URL]\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit \\nShanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents with\\nus, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\\nUS$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.\\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or\\noffice including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the\\nservices of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and\\ncourt affidavits which will put you in good standing as the \\nnext-of-kin.\\nA bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later \\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the \\nratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.\\nBe informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to \\nthis project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my \\nposition as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execution \\nof this transaction. If you are interested, please\\nrevert back to me.\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capable and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar\\nThanks and regards.\\nMr. Usman Ramat Shehu\\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save \u00a37.50 a month \\n[URL]www.freeserve.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

African Development Bank (ADB)Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso . \\nDear Friend, \\nI Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa .\\nIn my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.\\n \\nSince we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n \\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.\\n \\nthe bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\nIn subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.\\nAs soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.\\nTo make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.\\n \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer. \\n \\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\nHoping to hear from you immediately.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable  the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97\u00a0immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully,\u00a0Trevor Gumel\u00a0\u00a0(Esq.)POST  SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this  business.FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar MSN Toolbar Get it now!\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This \\nmoney was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as\\npersonal belongings and as such the security company does \\nnot know the true content of the boxes.This money was \\noriginally meant to be used for his political campaign. \\nBecause I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me \\nwith the relevant document papers relating to this deposit \\nbefore he died of cardiac arrest.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with \\nan offshore Security Company to move this money as a \\nconsignment through diplomatic means to their offshore \\naffiliated office where you will be required to put claim \\nto the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the \\nconsignment. You should know that this business is safety \\nand 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or \\nTerrorist fund.\\n \\nIf you are interested to carry out this transaction with \\nme, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general \\nexpenses, and 75% for us.\\n\\nYou are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full \\nname and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement \\nthat will guide and protect both of us in this transaction \\nalso which will be used to effect the change of ownership \\nof the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the \\nconsignment.\\n\\nAlso send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy \\ncommunication\\n \\nOnce you notify me your willingness by sending the above \\nrequirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 \\n(seven) working days.\\n\\nI will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on \\nmy Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-\\nmail: williamsfalana@caramail.com \\n\\nBest regards, \\nBarrister Williams Falana {SAN} \\n______________________________________________________\\nBo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - [URL]http://www.caramail.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n--=_NextPart_Caramail_0054031032174770_ID--\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
