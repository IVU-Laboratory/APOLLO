Additional commission cuts, the\\naftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock market, has had a cumulative\\neffect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know that we will need to work\\nharder, work smarter, and work together. We have gotten a tremendous amount of\\nsupport from travel agents and this has translated into the ability to get\\nmore support for travel agents from suppliers.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur focus has expanded from providing a resource for searching supplier\\nSpecial Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create\\nsales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier\\nsupported and FREE to travel agents.\\n\\n  * Actively seek out the best e-commerce values\\n  * Help you market Special Offers to your clients\\n  * Host personal web sites for travel agents with MailPound content*\\n  * Offer higher commissions through consolidation\\n  * Organize sales incentives from suppliers\\n  * Provide new technology for fast and easy online bookings\\n  * Provide your clients with the ability to book through you, online\\n\\n* MP _direct_ services are offered for $9.95/month\\n\\n\\n\\nWe invite you to visit us soon at [URL]www.mailpound.com[/URL] or check out the links\\nshown below.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend,\\nI am Ata Yusuf 24 years of age, from Darfur, Sudan, the only surviving Son of the family of Ibrahim Yusuf who was a civil engineer before his death in May 21, 2004 as a result of the crisis in Darfur, Western Sudan. You can read more about the crisis in Dafur, Sudan by click on this weblink; [URL]http://www.savedarfur.org[/URL] This unforgettable incident claimed the lives of my parents while my sisters and I were in school, as such we have been in a refugee camp since the death of our parents before a kind hearted woman took me to London, Uk where I have currently seek asylum. As such I am in great need of help now because I need to move my sisters out of the refugee camp back home in Sudan, to settle down with me here in London. \\n\\nI am writing you now because I need you to help me claim the funds my father deposited in a security and finance company in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He deposited the sum of $3.8million us dollars (three million and eight hundred thousand united states dollars) in this security and finance company which I discovered shortly before leaving my country for Uk. I have the relevant document that will be require for the claim of the funds but my problem now is that I am not in the position to handle such huge amount of money here because of my immigration status. It might interest you to know that I have already establish communication with the security company to claim the funds as the heir of my family, unfortunately that is just all I can do by myself for now. As a result, In a nut shell i need you to help me remit the funds from the security company on my behalf, I am sure it will not take too much of your time because I have everything that will facilitate the quick release of the funds to you.\\n\\nI am counting on you to help me in most sincerity and not to take undue advantage of my present situation as I will be basically entrusting you with these funds. Once you get the funds, you have to send me some money that will be enough for my sisters to arrange for their traveling documents to come over to London to join me. \\n\\nFinally, I will need you to invest the rest funds in a profitable partnership business venture in your country, we will discuss our partnership terms when we arrange to meet after the completion of this transfer.\\n\\nI hope to hear from you soon, my regards to your family.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nAta Yusuf.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).\\n \\nAll subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now \\ndecided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.\\n \\nThe reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside \\nmarriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjs property for her \\nand her son.\\n \\nYou must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing \\nyou as the only beneficiary.\\n \\nThe banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not \\npermanently resident in Switzerland.\\n \\nFor your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank \\nfunds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are \\nconcerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.\\n \\nIf you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will \\nproceed.\\n \\nI must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at [URL]www.royaltrust.com[/URL]\\n \\nWe await your timely response.\\n \\nBest Regards\\n \\nDR PETER CLAPTON\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"JPN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
