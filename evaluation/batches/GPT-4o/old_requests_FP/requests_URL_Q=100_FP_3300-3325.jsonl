I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to Live, according to medical experts.\\n\\nI have not particularly lived my Life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on \\nmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all these as I now know that there are more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.\\n\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I \\nwould live my Life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that \\nGod has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and \\nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few \\nclose friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided \\nto give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some \\ncharity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my \\nhealth has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.\\n\\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and \\ndistribute the money which I have there to charity organization in \\nBulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. \\n\\nHence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended \\nwith what I have left for them.\\n\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $20,500,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.\\n\\nI have set aside 15% for you, then 5% for any expenses insured.\\n\\nGod be with you.\\n\\nSALIM IBRAHIM\\n\\nNOTE: PLEASE I WISH TO SINCERELY ADVICED THAT I CAN BE REACHED ON MY WEBMAIL ADDRESS BELOW:\\n\\nsalim_ib@myway.com\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at [URL]http://frenchdog.ru[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"RUS\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section \\nof AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. \\nWith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to \\nkeep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service \\nafter we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nGeorge Path.\\n\\nMOBILE NUMBER: 00226 78 01 64 64.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \\ntlphone portable !

This business request may seem strange, but\\nI crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am\\nconvinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to\\na money transfer.\\n  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with \\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr.Robert Rice  made a numbered  time (fixed)\\ndeposit for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars\\n)in  my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his\\nforwarding address but got no reply.\\n  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\\nhis contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.Robert\\nRice and his wife Mrs. Mary Rice died in the plane crash On October\\n31, 1999, (an  Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers\\non board as you can  confirm it yourself via the website below: \\n\\n [URL]http://www.greatdreams.com[/URL]\\n\\n On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a\\nWill and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I\\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr.Robert\\nRice did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his\\nofficial documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.\\nThis sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over\\nwith the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever\\ncome forward to claim it according to African law, at the expiration\\nof (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the\\nSenegal Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\\n  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner\\nto  stand as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Rice so that the fruit of\\nthis  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\\nGovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\\nimmediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will\\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in\\nplace as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of an attorney\\nfor the drafting and notarization of the Will and obtain the\\nnecessary\\ndocuments and letter  of probate administration in your favour for\\nthe transfer.\\n  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide\\nwill  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\\nbeneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for\\nus to share in ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you.. There is no\\nrisk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and\\nmy position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful\\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply\\nimmediately via the private email address below, upon your\\nresponses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant\\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction.\\n   Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that\\nthis  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\\nshall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the\\nfollowing  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer\\ninto your bank account:\\n   1.) The beneficiary's name.\\n   2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\n   3) Your address.\\n\\nAwaiting your Urgent Reply via my private\\nemail:zatajoseph@netscape.net .\\n\\nThanks and God bless,\\nMR JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA.\\nMANAGER:\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
