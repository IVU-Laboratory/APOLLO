[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend, \u00a0 REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. \u00a0\u00a0 I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, weremandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitivepositions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very greatimportance for security reasons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yours Faithfully,\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Peter Olis. \u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------Encuentra tu casa r\u00e1pida y c\u00f3modamente.

Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.  Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.  Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  Thanking you in advance.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear sir,   I have a proposal foryou - this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to go honour against your will.    I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African  leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank  existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which  belong to a Syria national who is now late.    When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor  withdrawals from this account for this long period, I  and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a  system investigation and discovered that non of the  family member nor relations of the late Syrian is  aware of this account.    This is the story in a nutshell.    Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer  this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all  related documents for this account. It is a careful  network and for the past eleven months we have worked  out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.      The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all  the accumulated interest the balance in this account  stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.    Now our questions are:-    1. Can you handle this project?  2. Can we give you this trust?  3. What will be your commission?    Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.    Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as  contained herein be accorded the necessary  attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.    We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this  project. send a mail for confirmation.      Respectfully yours,    MR.Daniel Innoma. ------------------------------------------------------------ [URL]http://Game.37.com[/URL]  <--- Free Games [URL]http://newJoke.com[/URL]   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"CHN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
