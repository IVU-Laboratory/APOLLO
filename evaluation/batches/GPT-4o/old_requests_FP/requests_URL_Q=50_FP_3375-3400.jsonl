Col. KABONGO LOKOMBOH, who was the \\nChief Security Officer to the late President Laurent Kabila of Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo, with regards to your trustworthiness and reliability, I \\ndecided to seek for your assistance in transferring some money out of South \\nAfrica into your country, for onward dispatch and investment. \\n\\nI will reveal to you, based on the fact that I could rely on you, the height of \\nthe crisis that led to Laurent Kabila assassination, he personally mandated and \\ninstructed my husband to create and fully equip special elite force, to protect \\nhim against the rebels then, working against his government. This instruction \\nwas very discreet and highly confidential and was backed up with the sum of \\nUS$18.000, 000.00 (Eighteen million United States Dollars) in cash, for the \\npurchase of Arms and Ammunition from an independent arms dealer in Republic of \\nSouth Africa. \\n\\nWe brought this fund to South Africa, where he was supposed to negotiate and \\npurchase the Arms and Ammunition. This money was transported through diplomatic \\nmeans, and negotiation was still in progress when the news came to me that our \\nPresident has been shot. He then quickly decided to stop all negotiations and \\ndiverted the all funds to our personal use, as it was golden opportunity. He \\nthen left the children and me and went back home to attend the funeral of \\nLaurent Kabila where he was also killed. \\n\\nThis money is presently deposited in a Security Company here in Johannesburg, \\nSouth Africa since January 2001 although the Security Company does not know the \\nreal content of the box. We deposited it as family treasure containing Gold and \\nDiamond. I now seek your assistance in providing an overseas account to enable \\nme transfer this money out of South Africa, to where it can be invested. I have \\nmade all the necessary arrangement on our own side to ensure smooth remittance. \\nHowever, due to my refugee status I cannot operate a bank account here, neither \\ncan I invest here in South Africa. Hence my desire is to transfer and invest in \\nyour country. Please note that your account has got to be in a position to carry \\nthat amount of money. \\n\\nFor your assistance, after the transaction, I have agreed to give you 15% of the \\ntotal sum, while the balance of 85% will be for my investment. I intend to keep \\nmy presence here in South Africa low profile due to my popularity back home, so \\nI request all information provided to be kept secret and confidential. \\n\\nI am obliged to provide details immediately as soon as I receive the \\nacknowledgement of this letter from you, indicating your interest to assist me. \\nYou can contact us with the above e-mail or preferably, through e-mail: \\nlokomboh@msn.com \\n\\nBest regards, \\n\\nLUCY LOKOMBOH \\n\\n\\nPowered by Tiscali - [URL]http://www.tiscali.co.za[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

This is by virtue of its nature\\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though\\nI know that a transaction of this magnitude will make\\nanyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you\\nthat all will be well at the end of the day. \\n\\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\\ndecided it is best using the email. Let me start by\\nfirst introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.\\nKaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry \\nof Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board\\nappointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of\\nNigeria to award contracts to individuals and\\ncompanies and to approve such contract payments in the\\nMinistry of Mines and Power. The duties of the\\ncommittee also include evaluation, vetting and\\nmonitoring of work done by foreign and local\\ncontractors in the ministry.\\n\\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \\n\\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\\nrural electrification projects. \\n\\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\\nintention that the committee will share the excess\\nwhen the payments are approved. \\n\\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\\nand contractors concerned which executed the\\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\\nourselves.\\n\\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\\nhandicapped \\nin the circumstances as the civil service code of\\nconduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore\\naccounts, hence your importance in the whole\\ntransaction. \\n\\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \\n\\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not want\\nto miss this once in a life time opportunity.\\n\\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\\ncases of business associates running away with funds\\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\\nbe based completely on the following: \\n\\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\\ndiligence. \\n\\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \\n\\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \\n\\n(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough\\ninformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. \\n\\nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\\nrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten\\nBank working days from the date of  receipt of the\\nnecessary information and requirement from you. \\n\\nEndeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter\\nusing my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email\\naddress mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into\\nthe\\ncomplete picture of the transaction when I have heard\\nfrom you. \\n\\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated as we\\nare already behind schedule for this financial\\nquarter. \\n\\nThank you and God bless. \\n\\nYours faithfully, \\n\\nMr Joe Mark\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!

I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in\\nAfrican developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist\\nsearch.\\n\\nWhen i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability\\nand reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God\\nor Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15\\nmillion U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account\\nthat belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire\\nfamily in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got\\ninformation about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to\\ncome over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody\\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in\\nour banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed\\nnext of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving\\nnobody behind for the claim.\\n\\n It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my\\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release\\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety\\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u0092t\\nwant this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that\\n30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the\\nprovision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses\\nincured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman\\ncolleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement\\naccording to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this\\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of\\nfear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.\\n\\nYou should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon\\nas you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

During auditing, in \\nour bank at the end of last fiscal year, We discovered the\\nsum of (US$28.1M) Twenty-eight million one hundred thousand United States \\ndollars in a dormant\\naccount belonging to an international businessman based here in benin \\nrepublic who was involved in the December 25th Benin plane crash. I kept \\nthis information(secret) confidential within my\\njurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through \\ntrustworthy person whom we\\nshall present to our bank as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased.\\n\\nPlease visit\\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n\\nOur investigations so far clearly reveals that there is no immediate \\nsurvivor or even a relation to the deceased and as such,there is no \\nimmediate next of kin for further claims of the deceased fund as we have \\nlong been expecting someone to come forward with an applications. Further\\ninformations /verifications from reliable sources too have confirmed that \\nthe deceased customer supposed next of kin were all in the plane with him \\ndied with him.\\n\\nThis fund is now ready for transfer into a foreign account, whose owner will \\nbe portrayed to our bank as the beneficiary and a next of kin to the \\ndeceased customer. The foreign account owner will\\nimpost himself approprietly as the next of kin to the deceased and respond \\npositively like a true next of kin who wishes to speed up the release and \\ntransfer process of his inherited fund.Kindly be aware too that if the \\nover-due fund if not claimed by the end of next quarter, the National \\nTreasury\\nand Bills of Benin will take over the ownership of the fund in line with the \\nNational Edict Act of 1979. We do not want this to happen as it will not \\naugur to our best interest, having worked all our lives in the banking \\nsector, that is why I contacted you for us to do the deal together with\\nabsolute confidence, so that you will be portrayed as the bonafide \\nbeneficiary and an immediate next of kin to the deceased. I will give you \\nfurther directives, advice and all needed informations required for this \\ntransaction as soon as I receive your positive response. Similarly,if you \\naccept to carry out this transaction with us, we have resolved offering to \\nyou 30% of the total sum as\\ncommission, extra 10% of all proceeds to be generated from subsequent \\nprofit-viable investments\\nprojects and you will be compensated with an executive office in the \\nproject.The first-phase shall be a five (5) year irrevocable contractual \\nbusiness partnership. We will invest 50% of our shares into your firm if you \\nalready have one provided that is profit orientated. 5% of the total fund \\nwill be set aside to re-imburse all expenses incurred in this course of this \\ntransaction.

After going through some old files in the record, I discovered that the owner of this account is Mr. Smith.B. Andreas, from MUNICH GERMANY and a miner at Kruger Gold Company who died along with his entire family in a plane crash. Since 2000, No other person(s) knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$12.5M).\\n \\nFOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOW:\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n \\nI am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account Mr. Smith B. Andreas is a foreigner too. I need your full co-operation to make this transaction work, because the management is ready to approve the transfer of this money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will provide to you later. If you are able and willing to handle such amount in strict confidence and according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this is a lifetime opportunity. \\n \\nWith my position in the office I can lobby to transfer this money into your account, with the assurance that the money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country.\\nI will destroy all documents of transaction immediately this money is transferred, leaving no trace to any place. I will apply for my annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your bank account with appropriate clearance forms from the appropriate ministries and foreign exchange departments. \\nPlease reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications. \\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will get 30% of the total amount, 65% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incur during the transfer process. \\n\\nI look forward to your earliest reply, God Bless. \\n\\nSincerely Yours, \\n\\nDr.I.B Skosana (ABSA,Chief Auditor)\\n\\nFOR THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS BUSINESS, KINDLY SEND YOUR REPLY TO MY SPECIAL EMAIL: mribskosana@katamail.com\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2003\\n. \\nThe source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in my country, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.\\n \\nMy colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds, which are presently floating in our (Apex) Central Bank, ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.\\nHowever, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in my country. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$20,500,000.00  (Twenty million, five hundred thousand U.S. dollars). That is why I am seeking your assistance. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;\\n \\n(i) 25% to the account owner (you). \\n(ii) 65% for us (the panel officials). \\n(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both \\nyou and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.\\n \\nWe wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free.\\n \\nWe intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above: Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers; we will use your company\u0092s name to  apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.\\n \\nI will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

My name is Sizu Zamba  (Esq). a legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:\\n[URL]http://www.amarillonet.com[/URL] & \\n[URL]http://news.1chinastar.com[/URL]\\nMy late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Russian Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twelve Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($12,200,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in South Africa. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. I have employed every method to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this exercise has proved unsuccessful.\\nAfter the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The director of remittance of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.\\nI am convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.\\nI have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Expenses or Taxes as may be required. I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. \\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.\\nBest Regards,\\nBarrister Sizu Zamba (Esq).\\nN/B: PLEASE FORWARD YOUR RESPONSE TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL BOXT AT  sizuzamba@spinfinder.com  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
