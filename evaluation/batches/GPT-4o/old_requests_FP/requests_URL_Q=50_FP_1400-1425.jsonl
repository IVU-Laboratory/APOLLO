Perhaps we look at the sequences file > more than once per message view?   As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file  first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This  happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences. That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to  have a separate call for \"what sequences are in this folder?\" and \"what  messages are in this sequence?\".  One option would have been to add another  call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time  technique would be less error-prone. I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow  a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the  current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences  for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday. And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is nobody's problem but Habeas's. A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).   If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1, there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their thresholds to 5.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam, and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g., SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed. Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops, then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both created and monopolized a market for \"internet postage stamps\" that everybody has to pay them for. The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it. [*] And I use the term \"they\" loosely, because the whole company could  consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven.

Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card? Also, you could try \"alsactl store\", editing /etc/asound.state\" by hand (for me it contains data similar to what I can control with \"alsamixer\") then run \"alsactl restore\" and see if you're able to change what you want that way.

Could you take > a look if it can be included? It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the computer is halted, even using ALSA. I'm glad you got your card working with these! I'm now wondering if I won't maybe buy an amplifier that supports Dolby Digial decoding (my current one \"only\" does PRo Logic) since I've read that ALSA supports the S/PDIF optical output of the sound chip of my Shuttle!
