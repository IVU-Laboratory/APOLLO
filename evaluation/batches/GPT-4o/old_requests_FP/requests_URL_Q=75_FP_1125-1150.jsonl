Recently, in private email, \\nErnest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this \\nin-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) \\nlicensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many \\nways encouraged. \\n\\n*Tools:*\\n1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)\\n1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)\\n1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" \\n\\n*Process:*\\n1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for \\nyou.\\n2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \\nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \\ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \\n\\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \\ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \\nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or \\nviolate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer \\nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \\n\\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \\nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \\nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \\nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that \\nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

I say \\nhalf-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with \\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, \\non any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \\nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \\n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \\n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a \\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them \\n(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). \\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\nbash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the \\nwindow. \\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\nthat's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\nin a single directory (d:\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell \\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\nI don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\nmy D drive I have d:\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\nHOME environment variable), d:\\work (contains directories for each work \\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\nall programs that download things), and d:\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\ncreated CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. \\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\home\\phone. It is not in \\nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \\nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \\nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \\nmy single most backed-up possession. \\n\\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  [URL]http://bitworking.org[/URL]\\n[2]  [URL]http://www.winterspeak.com[/URL]\\n[3]  [URL]http://www.annoyances.org[/URL]\\n[4]  [URL]http://www.mozilla.org[/URL]\\n[5]  [URL]http://www.gnu.org[/URL]\\n[6]  [URL]http://www.activestate.com[/URL]\\n[7]  [URL]http://www.lavasoftusa.com[/URL]\\n[8]  [URL]http://www.openoffice.org[/URL]\\n[9]  [URL]http://sillydog.org[/URL]\\n[10] [URL]http://gpoulose.home.att.net[/URL]\\n[11] [URL]http://www.vmware.com[/URL]\\n[12] [URL]http://www.openoffice.org[/URL]\\n[13] [URL]http://www.cygwin.com[/URL]\\n[14] [URL]http://diveintomark.org[/URL]\\n[15] [URL]http://www.ultraedit.com[/URL]\\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\\n[16] [URL]http://www.microsoft.com[/URL]\\n[17] [URL]http://www.cygwin.com[/URL]\\n[18] [URL]http://www.guidescope.com[/URL]\\n[19] [URL]http://download.com.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}
