Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with  apt. Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least  (including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be  an easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt  doesn't always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in  RHL. >  > Even if it's possible, are there good reasons why maybe I should not do > it and just use the RH iso's (I don't think RH8 will upgrade from > (null), maybe up2date will)? It's possible but not supported by RH. I've upgraded both my laptop and my  home box from (null) to RH8.0 and didn't encounter any issues though. --  \t- Panu - _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

The only little (unimportant) catch is to replace \"kernel-headers\" by \"glibc-kernheaders\", a simple \"apt-get install glibc-kernheaders\" taking care of that. Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded, some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered as the newest, thus being kept on the system. As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released  version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they  sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your  own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means \"so much has been  changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release  anyway\".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this  from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me.    Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a  sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked,  well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with  and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below.  The first, \"no-bytecodes.png\",  shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode  interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, \"bytecodes.png\", taken with  the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several  rendering anomalies appear:    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in \"R\" and \"o\".    - The left side of the \"Q\" is painted in too light a shade of grey,      causing it to drop out somewhat.  \"C\", not in this sample, has the      same problem.    - \"Qu\" are set right up against each other, with insufficient      whitespace between them.    - \"M\" is distinctly asymmetric.    - The enclosed loop of \"a\" looks muddy, as it is partially filled      with grey.  Contrast with \"a\" drawn without the bytecode      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off.  It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of  making a mess of antialiased rendering. This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part,  I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode  interpreter turned *off*. --Boundary_(ID_xjiotMI3LbV/zJ0Zs39NiA) Content-type: image/png;

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the same time, this creates the problem that I cannot  run to the closest compter to check out the new mail.

Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

The two men pioneered the construction of giant\\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\\nthe sun by the billion.\\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because\\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\\nIn fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and\\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\\nsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.\\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize.

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It's very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they're here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\\nfact.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The new\\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\\nchurch.\\nNevertheless, the society said: \"It is clear that he prefers his private\\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\\n\"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\\ndown,\" it said.\\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an \"action plan,\" including calling on\\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\\nDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\\n\"taking steps towards appropriate direct action\".\\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\\nsociety's chairman, said: \"Watch this space.\" Presumably it could involve a\\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\\nis present.\\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\\nevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\\nA letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the\\nevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\\nteaching.\\nOn the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption\\nand blackmail. \"It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,\" she said.\\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. \"Matters of sexuality\\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.\"\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!
