It will be surprising  to you to\\nreceive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.\\nHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,\\nwhich I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name\\nis  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popular\\nblack farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my\\ncountry. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email,\\nafter searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means\\nI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe for\\nsecurity and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is not\\nacceptable to you.\\n\\n\\nThe purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a\\nbusiness venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,\\nas a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land Act\\nReform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black\\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw\\nthe danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrew\\nall of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares\\nin major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of\\nUS$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars),\\nin a private  security company. This money was deposited with this\\nPrivate Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to\\nbe used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals\\nestablishment of new  farms in Europe.\\n\\n\\nPresident Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  and\\nsome lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father\\nand other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my\\ninheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a\\nwhile, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder\\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands\\nwhere I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here\\nto seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has\\na branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in\\nJohannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an account\\nand invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a\\nrefugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial\\ntransaction, this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner,\\nwhose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal to\\nyou.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts my\\nfuture and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this\\nmoney. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is to\\nassist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company\\nfrom their office here in The Netherlands, as it has  now been\\ntransfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!  ca to their branch here. The\\ncompany will be legally informed of you  representing me.\\n\\n\\nFor your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can\\nchoose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me\\nopen an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into\\npartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money\\nin your country. Whichever the option you want, please to  notify me in\\nyour reply.  I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all\\nkinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction,\\nand 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10%\\nfor assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the\\naccount here for me.\\n\\nPlease, I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of\\nthis transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I\\nthank you in  advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me\\non my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via email\\nowenmubane1000@rediffmail.com. \\n\\n Sincerely, \\n\\n Owen Mubane.  \\n\\n\\nNOTE:  YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE FROM \\nTHE LINKS BELOW\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://www.1freespace.com[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"AUS\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It is\\ntherefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \\nproposal to you and release themoney to you as the next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement \\nsincenobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into \\nthe bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking and financial law and \\nguide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed \\nafterSEVEN years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury \\nas unclaimed fund. The request offoreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \\nand a national here cannot stand as next ofkin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a respect to the \\nprovision of a foriegn account ,10%will be set aside for expenses \\nincurred during the business and 50% would be for me Thereafter, I \\nwillvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentage \\nindicated Therefore, to enable theimmediate transfer of this fund to \\nyour country ,you must apply first to our security firm here in London \\nbecause of financial laws guiding this country,we have moved the money \\nin question to our Security Company Vault here in London for easy \\ntransfer of this fund to any where in the world.So i will like you to \\nsend tome your NAME,TELEPHONE NUMBER and PHYSICAL ADDRESS for easy and \\neffective communication and location where in\\nthe money is bound to.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will get back to you on the next moves \\nto make.

In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M \\n(fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that \\nbelongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in \\nthe 2000 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next \\nof  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\n  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  \\nindicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt \\nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at \\nthe plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this \\nbusiness  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or \\nrelation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank \\ntreasury as   unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained \\nunclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by\\nthe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as \\nnext of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you \\nas  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.\\n\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  \\nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  \\nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  \\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of \\nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should \\ncontact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,\\n\\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully.\\n\\nMrs MELIKA DIOUF,\\n\\nN/B: CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL OR WRITE EMAIL,AND YOU CAN \\nREPLY AND FRENCH TOO\\n\\nE-MAIL: melika_der_diouf@yahoo.fr\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Live Mail Beta !

Before the death we were both \\nborn again Christians. When my late husband was alive we deposited the \\nsum of USD$16.5Million (Sixteen Million Five hundred thosand U.S. \\nDollars) with one of good bank here in Nigeria. Presently, this money \\nis still with Union Bank of Nigeria.\\nRecently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three \\nmonths due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my \\nstroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to \\nchurch or better still Christian individual that will utilize this \\nmoney the way I am going to instruct here in.\\nI want a church that will use this fund to churches, orphanages, \\nResearch centres and widows propagating the word of God and to ensured \\nthat the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand \\nthat blessed is the hand that griveth.\\nI took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit \\nthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don;t want \\nmy family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.I don't want a \\nsituation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the \\nreason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I \\nknow where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the \\nLord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall \\nhold my peace.

I don't want them to know about this development.With \\nGod all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply. Ishall \\ngive you the contact information of the bank and whom to contact.\\nI will also need to get a reliable attorney to assist you as the new\\nbeneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for \\nme because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life \\nof a worthy Christian.Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve \\nhim in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your \\nlife.

You can \\n\\nconfirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD \\n\\nNEWS. \\n\\nWEBSITE. [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] Since his \\n\\ndeath, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money \\n\\nas his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his \\n\\nwife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his \\n\\naccount unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the \\n\\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \\n\\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a \\n\\nnext of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully \\n\\nworked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in \\n\\nyour \\n\\nfavor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the \\n\\nmoney will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and \\n\\nthe \\n\\nmoney shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i \\n\\ndecided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of \\n\\nkin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to \\n\\nshare \\n\\nthis money amongst themselves at the end of the year. \\n\\nIt may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an \\n\\norder of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please \\n\\nacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual \\n\\nbusiness \\n\\nendeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are \\n\\ninterested. \\n\\n1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for \\n\\ntransfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax \\n\\nnumbers. For \\n\\nour personal contact and mutual trust in each other. \\n\\nI shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars) \\n\\non final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the \\n\\nbalance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes. \\n\\nBecause I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction. \\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me \\n\\nimmediately.
