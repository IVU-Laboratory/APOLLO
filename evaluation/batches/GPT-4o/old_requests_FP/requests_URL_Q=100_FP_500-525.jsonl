Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours. It would be nice if it sees a header like: Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with  for ease of reading?

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences  -> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands  being issued and the responses. FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending  encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm  window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever  asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a  dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

New York is a bustling commercial city\\nand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young\\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\\ntowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic\\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\\nhistorical museums and in New York there's barely a\\nlittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.\\nIt's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's\\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb\\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\\nGrant, read his memoirs.

Based on the open source and free\\nsoftware initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages\\nartists to share with one another and their fans\\n\\nAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their\\nwork. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks\\nor performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without\\nrelying on intermediaries.

What the WSJ said, appended below. The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\" of the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *Commerce*. If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called \"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide. If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear. In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center. Cheers, RAH - ------- [URL]http://online.wsj.com[/URL],,SB1031705210159756235,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 11, 2002 REVIEW & OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273 fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2 =09az -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

Those who deny such a watershed event take a\\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\\n\\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\\ndealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\\nrepugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome.\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth.\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters \\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11.\\n\\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a\\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal\\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in high-rises.\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists.\\n\\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\\nidealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\\n\\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\\nsubsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \\nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \\nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \\nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\\n\\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into \"near-line\" \\narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \\narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \\nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \\nrecovered on demand.\\n\\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \\nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \\nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \\nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers \\nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \\ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\\n\\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \\neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \\nenvironments.\\n\\n\"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \\nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \\nfinancial documents and transaction records,\" said Mike Dooley, senior \\ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. \"Users may \\nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \\nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \\ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \\nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \\nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \\nenterprise applications.\"\\n\\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \\ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \\ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \\nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \\nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a \\nthree-year warranty.\\n\\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM \\nUltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. \\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation \\nserial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum \\ndata transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace \\nwith the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive \\nenvironments and enterprise applications.\\n\\nWith a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for \\nmanaging hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA \\nadvances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. \\nThe interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn \\nallows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with \\nincreased design flexibility and hot plug capability.\\n\\n\"Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that \\nhas previously been too expensive to keep on disk,\" said Dave Reinsel, \\nanalyst at IDC. \"The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and \\nwhen integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling \\ncost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have \\nbeen the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.\"\\n\\nAvailability\\nLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine \\nII and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in \\nthe fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus \\nII with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments \\nscheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.\\n\\nAbout Maxtor\\nMaxtor Corporation ([URL]www.maxtor.com[/URL] is one of the world's leading suppliers \\nof information storage solutions.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general\\ndealing-with-SPAM issue.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?\\nThere are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL\\nFROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think\\nmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a \"permanent\" error. That\\npretty much means, \"Don't bother to try from that address again,\\nyou'll get the same error.\" People often add cathartic messages to\\naccompany the 550 like, \"Spammers must die.\"\\n\\nBut this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers\\nthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to\\nget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?\\nThat is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but\\nthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how\\nSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP\\ntransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is\\ngoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.\\n\\nThen there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code\\nindicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is\\nsaying \"mailbox does not exist.\" This would be in the hopes that some\\nspammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from\\ntheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can\\nlower the incidence.\\n\\nSo, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of\\nthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be\\nhuge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to\\ngo... But sending back that \"Spammer die, die, die,\" or stock \"Access\\nDEE-NIED!\" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)\\n-- \\nCrist J.
