I have decided to\\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be\\nvery beneficial to both\\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank,\\nmy department came\\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a\\ndeceased person Mr.Andreas\\nSchranner who who died with his wife and their only\\ndaughter on July 2000 in\\na plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his\\naccount with this Bank\\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either\\nfrom his family or\\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S $10.150M ((Ten million one\\nhundred and fiftythousand\\nUS dolloars)).

This is the\\nactual reason why it will\\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward\\nclaims as the next of kin\\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also\\npresent a foreign\\naccount where he will need the money to be\\nre-transferred into on his\\nrequest as it may be after due verification and\\nclarification by the\\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole\\nmoney will be remitted from\\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction\\nis 100% risk free.

On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.\\nAfter about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .\\nPlease do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adress for security reason.\\nEmail ahmedtankoh200@yahoo.comI am waiting for your response.\\nThanks and God bless.\\nAhmed Tankoh .\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It has defiled all forms of\\n medicine, and right now I have only about a few\\n months to live, according to medical experts.\\n\\n I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\\n never really cared for anyone not even myself but my\\n business. Though I am very rich, I was never\\n generous, I was always hostile to people and only\\n focus on my business as that was the only thing I\\ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know\\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\\n or make all the money in the world.\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come\\n to this world I would live my life a different way\\n from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called\\n me, I have willed and given most of my properties\\n and assets to my immediate and extended family\\n members and as well as a few close friends.\\n I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul\\n and so, I have decided to give alms to charity\\n organizations, as I want this to be one of the last\\n good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed\\n money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,\\n Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\\n deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any\\n more. I once asked members of my family to close one\\n of my accounts and distribute the money which I have\\n there to charity organization in Bulgaria and\\n Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to\\n themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as\\n they seem not to be contended with what I have left\\n for them.\\n The last of my money which no one knows of is the\\n huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars\\n that I have with a Bank in london.\\n I will want you to help me collect this deposit and\\ndispatched it to charity organizations.email me\\n at giversworld@fastermail.com\\n I have set aside 10% for you for your time and\\n patience.\\n\\nGod be with you.\\n\\n Saidi Fatou.\\n\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\nGet free email address your_name@moldova.com at\\n[URL]http://www.moldova.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour Gateway to Moldova!\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\nSelect your own custom email address for FREE!

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign \\ncustomer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane \\ncrash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \\nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \\nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release \\nthe money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety \\nand subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want \\nthis money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of \\nthis money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision \\nof a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the \\nbusiness and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.\\n\\nThen after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \\naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \\ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \\nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \\nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \\neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . \\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \\nthe application.\\n\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free \\nand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required \\narrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me \\nimmediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor \\nof the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred.
