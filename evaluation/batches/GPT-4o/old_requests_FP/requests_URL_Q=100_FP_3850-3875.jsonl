CHEUNG PUI\\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\nHONG KONG.\\n \\n\\nLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui \\ndirector of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I \\nhave an urgent business suggestion for you.\\n\\nI honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much \\nembarrassment by contacting you through this means for \\na transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to \\nconfidentiality and prompt access reposed on this \\nmedium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands \\nnow,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, \\nand it is imperative for me to know your opinion\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi \\nBassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business \\nman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar \\nmonths, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several \\nnotice was sent to him, even during the war early this \\nyear. Again after the war  another notification was \\nsent and still no response came from him. We later \\nfind out that the Major and his family had been killed \\nduring the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered \\nthat Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin \\nin his official papers including the paper work of his \\nbank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time \\nhe was at my office that no one except me knew of his \\ndeposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five \\nHundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying \\nin my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim \\nit. What bothers me most is that according to the laws \\nof my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will \\nrevert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if \\nnobody applies to claim the funds. \\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I \\nwill like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of \\nkin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to \\nreceive his funds. \\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned \\nout so that we shall come out successful. I have \\ncontacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary \\ndocument that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , \\nall that is required from you at this stage is for you \\nto provide me with your Full Names and Address so that \\nthe attorney can commence his job. After you have been \\nmade the next of kin, the attorney will also file in \\nfor claims on your behalf and secure the necessary \\napproval and letter of probate in your favor for the \\nmove of the funds to an account that will be provided \\nby you.\\n\\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we \\nare going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney \\nwill prepare all the necessary documents. Please \\nendeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters \\nconcerning thisissue.Once the funds have been \\ntransferred to your nominated bank account we shall \\nshare in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% \\nfor any expenses incure during the transaction. Should \\nyou be interested please send me your full names and \\ncurrent residential address and I will prefer you to \\nreach me via my private box, \\n\\n{che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\nYour earliest response to this letter will be \\nappreciated.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr Cheung Pui.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from Karate Project WebMail Service [URL]http://www.karate-project.org[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. \\n\\nMULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE \\n\\nMLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the \"MLM Dream\" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. \\nThe fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. \\nThe companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story.

If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! \\n\\nWith your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. \\n\\nI promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. \\n\\nTo receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type \"Send Info\" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours.

If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any\\nexecutable program that they wish for monitoring.\\n\\nA lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected\\napplications is not running, the MAM feature, in\\nconjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for\\ncontinuous operation.\\n\\nIt's that simple!\\n\\nWatchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms\\n(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable\\nWatchdogs.\\n\\nWatchdog Control Center Features:\\n- Automated installation\\n- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs\\n- User selectable Watchdog timeout period\\n- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval\\n- Multiple Application Monitoring\\n\\nIncluded on the Installation CD:\\n- Watchdog Control Center\\n- Watchdog Drivers\\n- Documentation\\n\\nFor more information, please visit out website at\\n[URL]http://www.outsrc-em.com[/URL] or send an e-mail to sales@outsrc-em.com\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In my department. we discovered an abandoned sum of ??m euros (FOURTY Million\\neuros) in an account that belongs to one of our\\nforeign customer (MR. Rudi Fassnacht from Cologne, Germany) who died along with his entire family in Jully 2000 in a\\nplane crash.For more informations about the crash you\\ncan visit this site:\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been\\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his\\nmoney because we cannot release it unless some body\\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the\\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and\\nlaws but unfortunately we\\nlearnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation\\ndied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving\\nnobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I now decided to make this business\\nproposal to you and release the money to you as the\\nnext of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and\\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it\\nand we don't want this money to go into the Spanish\\ntreasury government account as unclaimed funds.\\n\\nThe banking law and guidline here stipulates that if\\nsuch money remained unclaimed after five years, the\\nmoney will be transfered into the government treasury\\naccount as unclaimed funds. The request of foreigner\\nas next of kin\\nin this business is occassioned by the fact that the\\ncustomer was a foreigner and a Spanish cannot stand as\\nnext of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a\\nrespect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%\\nwill be set aside for expenses incurred during the\\nbusiness and 60% will be invested in any lucrative\\nbusiness of your choice and as soon as this is done, i\\nwill resign from my work and join you immediatelly.\\nRemmember that the trust leed upon you is based on\\nmutual business understanding and a life time\\nopportunity which i believe you will not allow it go.\\n\\nTo enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you\\nas arranged,you must apply first to the bank as\\nrelation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of\\napplication \\nthat i will send to you,so i will like you to send to\\nme your private telephone and fax number for easy and\\neffective communication and location where the money\\nwill be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax\\nor email the text of the application .

QUESTIONS:  From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  Subject: Using pictures as links  I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages.  But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the  pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.   How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages  without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with  actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my  favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days.  Mark  moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com  Subject: Access using a proxy  >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com)  >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422)  --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is  blocking 50% of  the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by  using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is  there a way to get access to these sites? --  A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself.  I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then  from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that  block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money  with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and  because they allow me to surf anonymously!  I have a detailed right-up on them at  [URL]http://linkpaks.com[/URL]  See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work.  Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or  may not visit, then it is time to change providers!

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: [URL]http://www.BestWayToShop.com[/URL] Dale Pike  rhinopez@aol.com    Site #125: [URL]http://www.wedeliverparties.com[/URL] Dawn Clemons  dclemons7@home.com  Site #126: [URL]http://www.EClassifiedshq.com[/URL]  Carol Cohen  Opp0rtunity@aol.com  SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: [URL]http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com[/URL] Dennis  damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and  I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third  paragraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as  shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should  be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered  on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.   As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person  doing the page is always good.  We need some information about  why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to.  ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations  for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to  'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading  for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like  you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you  to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend  look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like  before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you  their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know  they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter.  It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your  newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or  an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that  page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text.  I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read  quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily.  I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds  site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted.  A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the  message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is  personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted  to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see  a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word  missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be  smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also  are errors in the following paragraphs :  \"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement,  send your to my email\" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's  newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be  a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to  have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably  didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be  better served if he at least put some of the things out there for  all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to  subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful  resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy  advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter  with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com)  asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad.  He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get  from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about  the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40  points size which gets difficult to read.  ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on  the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its  just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an  advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough  move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter  itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of  ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably  you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting  the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue,  a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click  for more info on your free ads.  ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!

QUESTIONS:  From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  Subject: Using pictures as links  I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages.  But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the  pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.   How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages  without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with  actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my  favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days.  Mark  moviebuff@cliffhanger.com  ANSWERS: From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com  Subject: Access using a proxy  >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com)  >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422)  --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is  blocking 50% of  the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by  using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is  there a way to get access to these sites? --  A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself.  I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then  from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that  block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money  with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and  because they allow me to surf anonymously!  I have a detailed right-up on them at  [URL]http://linkpaks.com[/URL]  See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work.  Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or  may not visit, then it is time to change providers!

SITES TO REVIEW: Site #124: [URL]http://www.BestWayToShop.com[/URL] Dale Pike  rhinopez@aol.com    Site #125: [URL]http://www.wedeliverparties.com[/URL] Dawn Clemons  dclemons7@home.com  Site #126: [URL]http://www.EClassifiedshq.com[/URL]  Carol Cohen  Opp0rtunity@aol.com  SITE REVIEWED: Comments on Site #123: [URL]http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com[/URL] Dennis  damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~ I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and  I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third  paragraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as  shown on the page. I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should  be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered  on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.   As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person  doing the page is always good.  We need some information about  why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to.  ~~~~ Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations  for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to  'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading  for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like  you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you  to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend  look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like  before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you  their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know  they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter.  It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your  newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or  an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that  page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~ I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text.  I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read  quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily.  I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds  site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted.  A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~ This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the  message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is  personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted  to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see  a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word  missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be  smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers* ~~~~ Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also  are errors in the following paragraphs :  \"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement,  send your to my email\" ~~~~ A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's  newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be  a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to  have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably  didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be  better served if he at least put some of the things out there for  all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to  subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~ What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful  resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy  advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter  with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com)  asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad.  He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get  from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about  the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40  points size which gets difficult to read.  ~~~~ A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on  the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its  just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an  advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough  move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter  itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of  ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably  you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting  the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue,  a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click  for more info on your free ads.  ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!
