Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier currently : 1. Leave your current kernel as-is 2. Get the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem, NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm. Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind. I see it more as a \"one size fits all\" achievement in the general case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules you'll ever need. Make that \"one size fits many\" then if you want ;-) Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

Indeed, my usual login is \"dude\" (and has been since long before \"The Big Lebowsky\" came out ;-)), and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code my home directory when being compiled :-( For instance : [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/gentoo | grep dude /home/dude/ [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude /home/dude/redhat/tmp/xine-root/usr/share/locale These should probably be considered bugs in the program's build process (especially for xine, look at that!), I'll report them upstream if/when I have some time.

Sure thing :) I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a \trpmbuild --recompile  --without oss --without isapnp (I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)). Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package installed.  I've added a flag \"kernsrc\", that also can be used --without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way to do that. I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs  don't help much. Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules from source.  It created the /dev files and all. Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec: rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp --without kernsrc But I get this: ==[long successful compile snipped]===================================== warning: File listed twice: /dev/adsp warning: File listed twice: /dev/amidi Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: /bin/sh /bin/sh rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(interp): /bin/sh /bin/sh Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(post): /bin/sh Requires(postun): /bin/sh Requires: alsa-kernel = 0.9.0rc3 /sbin/depmod Processing files: alsa-kernel-0.9.0rc3-fr4_2.4.19 Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires: alsa-driver = 0.9.0rc3 kernel = 2.4.19 Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root error: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound RPM build errors:       File listed twice: /dev/adsp       File listed twice: /dev/amidi       Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound ======================================================================== Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.    It is not in the filesystem, anyway. I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line in alsa-driver.spec: cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/ And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.

In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current user.

Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr... ugly!

It created the /dev files and all. That's what the \"alsa-driver\" is there for, create all the base files excluding the kernel drivers.

Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not listed in the %files section. I should remove them manually as part of the build process... or maybe the new \"%exclude /path/to/file\" in the %files section would do, but I don't know how older versions of rpm would handle it.

We raised the FSB one more step and managed to run  succesfully SuperPi benchmark while CPU was running at 3998MHz. The  result was 39 seconds.

Yeah, but these would be different cases relating to copyright infringements, not about ISP's blocking mail or not. --- Lars Hansson ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing  real-time communications platform!

It should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today. Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume things work differently than they do.
