[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Hello my beloved kind hearted,\\n\\n \\n\\nTHIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!\\n\\n \\n\\nI simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.\\n\\n \\n\\nBy my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.\\n\\n \\n\\nAll the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn't collect this money, directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members, because government will investigate \"why?\" and \"what for? Therefore, to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.\\n\\n \\n\\nYou will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more than $75,000, as the case may be.\\n\\n \\n\\n>From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining 10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it's simple and risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:\\n\\n \\n\\n(1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:\\n\\nProvide me with:\\n\\na). Name of your bank.\\n\\nb) Address of your bank.\\n\\nc) Bank Telephone and Fax.\\n\\nd) Account Number.\\n\\ne) Swift Code/Routing Number.\\n\\nd)Account Names.\\n\\n \\n\\n(2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:\\n\\n \\n\\nThen, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:\\n\\na) Your full names (As would be on the check).\\n\\nb) Contact/Mailing address\\n\\nc) Your Telephone and Fax Number.\\n\\n \\n\\nFurthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.\\n\\n \\n\\nOnce all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn conclusion:\\n\\n \\n\\nI wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who wrote:\\n\\n \\n\\n\"To exist is to change,\\n\\nTo change is to mature,\\n\\nTo mature is to go on creating one's self endlessly,\"\\n\\n \\n\\nAs we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.\\n\\n \\n\\nLET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis is simply from my heart to you.\\n\\n \\n\\nI wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you.\\n\\n \\n\\nKindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email addresses as stated.\\n\\n \\n\\nMy regards,\\n\\n \\n\\nK.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Adams, I am Barrister John Solomon a legal Solicitor and I was the Personal Attorneyand legal adviser to Mr.Joshua Adams, a national of your country,who used to work with Mobil oil Company here in Togo. On the 7th of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along imo Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives,this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail,hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get impounded by the security company were my client deposited this consignment(two trunkboxes). Particularly,the security company where the deceased had deposited this consignment valued at about eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($U.S8.5million) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the consignment confiscated/impounded within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over two years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this consignment valued at eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars($U.S8.5million)can be claimed by you and then you and i can share the money. Note that this consignment was recorded as family treasures belonging to my late client and only you and i knows the content of the two boxes with the security company. I will require your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangementthat will protect you from any breach of the law. Contact me via my private email (barrister_johnsolomon@yahoo.co.uk) to enable us discuss further.

Hope all is well. Please be informed that I have decided to contact you for a fund transfer transaction worth the sum of US$22,300,000.00 into your reliable bank account as the sole NEXT-OF-KIN to the foreign deceased customer of our bank (an International Billionaire French Businessman) who was killed with his entire family by PLANE-CRASH in Central England atmost 3 years ago. Since his death occured, no body have show up as his next of kin for the claim because the account is untraceable. Upon the investigation I carried out from his records, I found out that his foreign business consultant who would have trace the account died earlier before the deceased. Therefore, this is a confidential and sealed deal. For the success of this transaction, you should apply and act as the only existing NEXT-OF-KIN to the deceased which our bank will replace the deceased account information through proper documentation in position of your own account. This transaction is risk-free, it will never harm your good reputation in your society because no one can trace the account, and on the instant of the transfer of the fund into your account, the chapter of this transaction will be closed entirely. Note that in a business of this nature, the bank dont want to know your difference between the deceased country, religion or believe because our bank inheritance law is against that. So, it is a preference for us achieve this success without any problem.Please note down that once the fund get transferred into your account, you will take 39% of the total sum while the rest will be for me as I will arrange myself down to your country to take my share. I need your urgent response and include your private telephone/mobile numbers for easy communication.Please reply if you can be trusted in this deal.Thanks,  Mr.LAAD COLOGO.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nLancez des recherches en toute scurit depuis n'importe quelle page Web.

I am contacting you concerning a customer  \\nand an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  \\nfact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  \\nthe contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  \\nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  \\ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  \\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  \\ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\\n\\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  \\nto engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  \\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  \\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  \\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  \\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  \\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  \\nespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  \\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  \\nand however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  \\nprime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  \\nby assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  \\nmanagers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  \\nmoney around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  \\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  \\nstood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  \\nmargin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  \\nguaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  \\nmoney be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  \\nrequiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  \\nfunds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  \\nour bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  \\nin order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  \\n9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  \\ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  \\nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  \\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  \\nincidents of 9/11.\\n\\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  \\nmainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  \\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  \\ndeposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  \\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  \\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  \\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  \\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  \\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  \\ndeposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  \\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  \\nwe had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  \\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  \\nthat particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  \\nwas concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  \\nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  \\nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  \\nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  \\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  \\nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  \\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  \\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  \\nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  \\nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  \\nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  \\nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  \\npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  \\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  \\nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  \\naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  \\nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  \\naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  \\nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  \\nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  \\nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  \\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  \\ncare, in this case; he died in testate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have  \\npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  \\ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate, this  \\ninvestigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  \\ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  \\nget to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  \\nin my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  \\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  \\nestate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  \\ndeceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  \\nsupervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  \\nof the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  \\nhave considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  \\nor identifiable family member.\\n\\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  \\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  \\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  \\nthe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  \\nclaim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  \\nprobably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  \\nmoney entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  \\nout of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  \\nThis will not happen if I have my way.\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  \\nbut I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  \\nbanking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  \\naberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  \\nhuge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  \\nportfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  \\ndirection of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  \\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  \\none unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  \\nthis deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  \\ntransaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  \\nto the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  \\njust customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  \\nidea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  \\nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  \\nforward, and this is the situation.\\n\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  \\nof the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  \\nfamily but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  \\nI am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  \\nto release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  \\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  \\nhalf and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  \\nkin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  \\nproceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  \\nme, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  \\nin claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  \\nforeigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  \\nclaim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  \\nfew days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  \\nfile relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  \\nthe finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  \\nwith these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  \\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  \\nholder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  \\nthe money from the firm.\\n\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  \\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  \\nin this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  \\nyou do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  \\nto you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  \\nnot destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  \\nmay not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  \\ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  \\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  \\nmay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  \\ndictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  \\nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  \\nunderstand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  \\nto face with my destiny.\\n\\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  \\nchance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  \\nmove on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  \\nthis is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  \\nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  \\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  \\nrefusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  \\nknows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  \\ninto the center of relevance in my life, let\u0092s share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  \\nspecifically, through this email account (qin2wang2000@yahoo.com.cn),  \\nif you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards  \\na conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition  \\nshould you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny  \\nknowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you  \\ncontacting me through our official lines neither do I want you  \\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only  \\nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link  \\nbetween you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are  \\nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line  \\nwith our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this  \\ninstruction religiously.\\n\\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two  \\nkids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what  \\nthe consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured  \\nis nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a  \\nplatter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private  \\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one  \\naccord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has  \\nbeen completed plan a meeting, soon.\\n\\nI await your response.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nQin.\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
