Also, application browser bugs allow you\\nto target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,\\nor the mailing lists they frequent. It is a \"one button\" push attack, and\\nusing anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.\\n\\nThis vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia\\nFlash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever\\nShockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,\\nnews postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing\\nweb-browsing functionality.\\n\\nTechnical Description:\\nThe data header is roughly made out to:\\n\\n[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too\\nshort)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count\\n(malformed)][Data]\\n\\nBy creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the\\ndecoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function\\npointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as\\nsoon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes\\ncontrol flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back\\nfrom the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a\\n\"call dword ptr [esp+N]\", where N is the number of bytes from the stack\\npointer. These \"jump points\" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By\\ncreating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can\\nexamine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with\\nyour exploitation.\\n\\nThis is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been\\nfound in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we\\nended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.\\n\\nProtection:\\nRetina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of\\nFlash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their\\nsystems.\\n\\nVendor Status:\\nMacromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:\\n[URL]http://www.macromedia.com[/URL]\\nPSB02%2D09%20%2D%20Macromedia%20Flash%20Malformed%20Header%20Vulnerability%2\\n0Issue&Cache=False\\n\\nDiscovery: Drew Copley\\nExploitation: Riley Hassell\\n\\nGreetings: Hacktivismo!, Centra Spike\\n\\nCopyright (c) 1998-2002 eEye Digital Security\\nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this alert\\nelectronically.

If you only filter 75% of spam, \\nyou're wasting your time.

Well, when studying engineering the rule of thumb was that infinity was 10 times bigger then the most you could expect to use. Therefore I believe in infinite stack. But I do not feel I am a compiler risk either. So where does this leave me? - Matthew __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?
