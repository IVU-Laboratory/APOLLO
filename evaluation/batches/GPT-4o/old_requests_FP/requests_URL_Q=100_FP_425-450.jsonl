This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness. 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.   [URL]http://www.picotech.com[/URL] 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn. 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/ What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply \"./configure --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver\" from the alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run \"depmod -a\". Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own kernel. I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a kernel recompiled with ACPI.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument  against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that  they  a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some  sort of autodetection and changing crap) b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because  formats have changed. Red Hat is not \"taking it easy\" on this, it's putting control in the hands  of you, the maintainer of the machine.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put  /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use  the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the  data as is. If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need  to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup  and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over  ssh.  It's the best way to make backups. > These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.     Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.     I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  \"apt-get dist-upgrade\" dumps core.     What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian Fahrlnder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad Evansville, IN                    My Voyage: [URL]http://www.CounterMoon.com[/URL] ICQ  5119262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with compassion and vision.

If you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.   score RAZOR_CHECK 10 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient. If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient. Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA won't do it and avoid the double network hit. However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as Razor1.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating \"Named Objects\", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for \"Named Objects\". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on \"Named   Objects\". - Current types of \"Named Objects\" include:     NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication  \tFramework     AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using \tdigital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain:  - Core: \thard coded root public key, for authenticating top level \tNameSpaces  - Signing Services: \tImplementation of web based signing services \tEnd user hosted signing service  - Example User Authentication Application  - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

Cheers, RAH [URL]http://www.newsmax.com[/URL] NewsMax.com Wednesday, September 18, 2002 AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, \"the No. 1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on [New York's] Upper East Side. \"It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store\" on Madison Avenue, which features \"rich vulnerable women,\" the mag's October issue says. AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting place published, or being cited as the \"in\" place for finding loaded women - or rather, women who are loaded. \"The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!\" an AA spokesman told The Post. O.K. Return --  ----------------- R. A.

Both can be found here : [URL]http://ftp.freshrpms.net[/URL] I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2. [URL]http://ftp.freshrpms.net[/URL] Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty new features : You can use any of \"--with ldap\", \"--with mysql\" and \"--with postgres\" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set accordingly, and the release tag is changed too. [URL]http://valhalla.freshrpms.net[/URL] (the usual place ;-)) I think I'll use this \"--with \" switch more and more where possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec to enable Pilot support.

He offended conservatives and the\\n# politically correct left with his 1998 novel \"Les Particules\\n# Elementaires\" (\"Atomised\" in English).\\n#\\n# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted\\n# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme\\n# admit he felt \"a quiver of glee\" every time a \"Palestinian\\n# terrorist\" was killed.\\n#\\n# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National\\n# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in\\n# bringing Houellebecq to trial.\\n#\\n# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying\\n# Houellebecq's comments amounted to \"Islamophobia\" and deserved to be\\n# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination\\n# and racism.\\n#\\n# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading\\n# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former\\n# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for\\n# sending Jews to death camps.\\n#\\n# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case\\n# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact\\n# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says\\n# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.\\n#\\n# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour\\n# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the\\n# article before it appeared.\\n#\\n# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the\\n# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's\\n# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.\\n#\\n# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached\\n# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to\\n# love.\\n#\\n# Translated into 25 languages, \"Atomised\" incensed France's 1968\\n# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won\\n# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the\\n# world's biggest fiction prizes.\\n#\\n# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.\\n\\n- Gordon\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down\\nin price. Hearing that the only \"officially\" functional Windows player is\\nMusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch\\nis a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why\\ndo we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware\\nunit?\\n\\nAt first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows\\ncompatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides\\nsong management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a\\nbetter option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with\\nalmost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management,\\nvia Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your\\nPC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off\\nApple's officially endorsed player.\\n\\nLori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's\\nSIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of\\nwinferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the\\nfree copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees.

At first\\nGeorge and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-\\nadjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George\\nand Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty\\ncocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as\\nquickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology\\nprofessor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy\\nDennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic\\nexchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find\\nthemselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.\\nThroughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely\\nchoreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead,\\nalternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.\\nThankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost\\nunadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and\\nimpeccable timing. At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with\\nHumiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how\\nabout a little round of Get the Guests?\" This provides some idea of the\\nprecarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to\\nfinish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is\\nTaylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok,\\nI will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not\\nhave been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with\\nthe chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying\\nslaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax\\nor look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is\\nnot a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a\\nmemorable film that will stick with you for years to come.\\n\\n  * Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only) \\n  * Format: Black and White, Widescreen Anamorphic, Closed Captioned \\n  * Sound: (Dolby Digital 5.1) \\n  * Production Notes \\n\\nReview by Brett Trout\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeWALLPAPER  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n**purple flower forWallPapers** by tatosh  \\n![](/images/blank.gif) Posted on 7/17/2002 12:35:01 AM --  \\n\\n![purple flower by\\ntatosh]([URL]http://www.wincustomize.com[/URL]\\n\\n[Download]  \\-- [Zoom]  \\-- [Visit WinCustomize]\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]  \\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Create and decompress zip archives\\nwith the Chilkat Zip ActiveX control. The control provides easy access to\\nindividual files stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within\\nthe zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual files or files\\nmatching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to any directory, and the control's\\nmemory management allows any size file to be compressed or decompressed in a\\nconstant memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly from\\nmemory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files with wildcarding.\\nThere's even a real-time progress monitor for zip and unzip operations.\\nChilkat supports Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++\\nBuilder, and all languages that use ActiveX controls.\\n\\nin Java  \\n**Anfy Java 2.0**  \\nAnfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop wallpapers, or\\nscreensavers. Within the program's simple interface, you can quickly apply\\nreal-time graphic effects to GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-\\nmapped cube menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom rotators,\\nlens magnification, waving flags, animations, scrolling text, customizable IFS\\nfractals, color changers, light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.\\n\\nin Tools & Editors  \\n**VB-PowerWrap 3.1**  \\nDistribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with VB-PowerWrap. VB-\\nPowerWrap embeds all dependent and non-dependent files into the executable of\\nyour VB program, including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,\\nto create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans a VB project,\\nwraps the appropriate files, and creates a self-contained file for\\ndistribution. In addition, VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and\\nregisters appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It works with\\nVisual Basic 4, 5, and 6.\\n\\n![This Week's Top Ten Downloads]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n|   | **Most Popular Titles**  \\nWeek ending July 14  |    **Last  \\n  Week**  |    **Weeks  \\n  on Chart**  |    **Downloads  \\n  This Week**  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n1. | **Microsoft Windows Installer (95/98/Me) ** |  2|  84|  9,082  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n2. | **Microsoft Data Access Components RTM** |  3 |  84 |  8,901  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n3. | **Java 2 Runtime Environment, SE ** |  4 |  84 |  8,197  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n4. | **Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime Module SP5 **|  5 |  73 |  7,960  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n5. | **Mozilla (32-bit) ** |  7|  5|  6,683  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n6. | **ActiveX Control Pad ** |  6 |  7 |  4,030  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n7. | **UltraEdit-32** |  11 |  84 |  2,995  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n8. | **Borland C++ Compiler** |  9 |  60 |  2,492  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n9. | **Java 2 Development Kit** |  10 |  84 |  2,177  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n10. | **TextPad (32-bit) **|  12 |  84 |  2,056  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n![Sign up for more free newsletters from\\nCNET!]([URL]http://a.r.tv.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions  | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL] |  Price comparisons | Product reviews\\n| Tech news | Downloads | All CNET services | ![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.
