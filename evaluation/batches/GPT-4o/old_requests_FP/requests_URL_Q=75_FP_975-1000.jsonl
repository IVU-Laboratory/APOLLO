The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter\\nwill continued to be published every Friday\\n\\nWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one\\nis giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in\\norder to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months\\nnow, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little\\ntired.\\n\\nAlso, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or\\nmeet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time\\nto get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.\\nSo it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\\n\\nHaving additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects\\nI've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer\\nElectronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are\\nnailed down.\\n\\nFor now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn\\nout to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer\\nand see how it works.\\n\\nI appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be\\nless frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-\\ndemand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDavid Coursey  \\nExecutive Editor  \\nAnchorDesk\\n\\n  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n| ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n**Sign up for morefree newsletters from ZDNet**  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is qqqqqqqqqq-zdnet@example.com\\n\\nUnsubscribe |  Manage My Subscriptions | FAQ |  Advertise  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] |\\n![ZDNet]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL] | Home\\n|eBusiness | Security | Networking | Applications | Platforms | Hardware |\\nCareers | ![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---|---|---|---|---  \\n![]([URL]http://www.zdnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\n|\\n\\n  \\n**Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.

Simple.\\nDownload all you want - we'll definitely make more. In fact, we've found a way\\nto get your products and services a little bit of unlimited promotion on the\\nside, too. And who couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless\\nyour data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you get\\nfeatured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls to its knees.\\nWe're still sitting at #5 on Amazon. If we ever hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And,\\nmind you, this hat has been sitting around for quite a while; it smells like\\nfeet. You'd have to eat three sombreros just to get the same amount of\\nnutrition you'd get from my hat. You're better off just going for the free\\nstuff, I suppose. The next time they ask: \"Do you care to Super Size that?\"\\nYou can respond, with dignity: \"My funds are sufficient for the upgrade; I\\navoided spending money on something that would have lasted longer, supported a\\nhelpful cause, and not have killed me earlier.\" It makes sense - if you think\\nabout it. The fries aren't going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the\\nfries, who will?\\n\\nPut your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph I like to\\ncall: \"Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL.\" They went out of their way to\\nsend me an unsolicited e-mail this evening. Now, I know what you're thinking:\\n\"How kind of them, Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in\\nyesterday's issue. They must have read your mind!\" No, they must have rented a\\nlist of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop there. I\\nreceived a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER marketing company. Their\\neffort was indeed caught by this crafty eye, and my money will be diverted to\\nother (less-spammish) businesses in the future. It's my \"direct\" way of\\nsaying: you're not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my\\npatience? I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people from\\naround the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more junk; looks like\\nLycos will never get another click from me, either. See what you get when you\\ntempt fate?\\n\\nMy good buddy, Bill, tells me that Speakeasy.net provides great DSL\\nconnections. He'll even get the credit if I sign up through his affiliate\\nlink! Paul Howes agrees with him, too: \"Static IPs are the norm, they do not\\nuse PPPoE, and they encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection.\\nWhen looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home Services'\\npage. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k upstream, which I have\\nnot seen from any other provider. And that is less than $200 a month, which is\\na bargain when you start looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!\" And\\nStuart Portner is chock full of common sense: \"Remember that a lot of DSL\\nproviders give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at\\nleast for initial setup / shakedown period.\" All the more fries for me, dude!\\n\\nSee You in August,  \\nChris Pirillo  \\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeCONFERENCE  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n![Heigh-Ya!]([URL]http://chris.pirillo.com[/URL]  \\n$99 Pre-Registration / $150 At The Door\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeDOWNLOADS  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\n|  | **Today's Downloads**  \\n---  \\nAppPlus 3.24  \\nEaseBackup 3.70  \\nHotCrypt 4.12  \\nArles Image Web Pa 4.94  \\nSmasher 2.9.12  \\nThe Bat! 1.61  \\nWinSafe 1.1.2  \\nPrivacy Eraser 1.68  \\nZero Popup 3.0  \\nWinPulse 1.01  \\n  \\n**Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**\\n\\n[URL]http://www.toteboard.net[/URL]\\n\\n{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the best thing to\\ndo with your money is to invest and then \"forget about it.\" Our Gnomie buddy\\nBrian Stevens is the type of guy that likes to play the stock market.

With Flexible Renamer, I can\\ncut off the \"Shortcut to\" and \"Copy of\" prefixes from all my files, making\\nthem a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even make a .txt\\nfile on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.

You walk into\\ndifferent stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and\\nyou will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be disappointed\\nwhen you go around the corner and pick up your Avengers icons from the comic\\nstore. If all this wasn't good enough then maybe this fact alone will send you\\nto the street of Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This\\nmeans you can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux\\nmachine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities are endless!\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n GnomeTIP  \\n  \\n---  \\n  \\nI just hate it when I try to install a program and the installation fails. I\\nhate it even more when the program doesn't leave a log file to help me track\\ndown the problem. Some would say I am out of luck, but as long as the program\\nuses Windows Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because\\nfor any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging through the\\nRegistry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ Software \\ Policies \\ Microsoft \\\\nWindows \\ Installer. Add a new String value, double-click it, and enter the\\nfollowing Value data: \"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes). These letters can be\\nentered in any order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =\\nStatus messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error messages; w = Non-\\nfatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r = Action-specific records; m = Out-\\nof- memory or fatal exit information; u = User requests; p = Terminal\\nproperties. If you add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add\\nan exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails, I just\\nhave to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log files. They'll vary\\nin name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and end with the .LOG extension. As\\nalways, make sure to backup your registry before making any modifications.\\n\\nRecommend It!\\n\\n  \\n\\n|  [URL]http://www.lockergnome.com[/URL]\\n\\nYour subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To\\nunsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription\\nmanagement page.

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner  and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for \"qmail newbie's guide to relaying\". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

There are already patches for this, look at the Conectiva apt-list archives, you should find them there. Also, apt 0.5 is being actively developed and already contains enough fixes to be compiled on Limbo with gcc 3.2. > In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really > started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added.

You can still use an apt package compiled on Red Hat Linux 7.3 as long as you install the \"rpm404\" package for compatibility. That's what I'm doing currently on my home Rawhide system.

So either you can choose to have a \"docs\" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting : %doc docs (or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory) %doc docs/ Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} : %doc docs/* Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not already clear for you. You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be listed when using \"-qd\" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with absolute filenames, for example : %doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual (this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file) Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka %{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc. > Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies? > as for example with gnuboy, all hte docs and the website says is it > needs SDL. >  > Do I set a Requires: SDL >= 1.2 (as my system uses SDL-1.2.4-5) or just > put Requires: SDL. Build the package once and see if it checks for a specific version, or read the installation notes. Often you'll see \"checking for SDL >= 1.2.0\" for example when running configure, then it's best to also make the package depend on that version. > One more quick question, I'm used to compiling source code no problem > (cannot program, but stumble through), whats the best way for finding > out what RPMS are needed for the Requires & BuildRequires macros? > apart from read all the docs and websites info. Well, read the docs indeed :-) You can also compile the package once without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for (basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:) then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those \"Requires:\" and rebuild a final version of the package. Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled, BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel Requires: gnome-libs will be enough since they already depend on the \"lower level\" libs that are glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf. > Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the > best one to ask.
