It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\\nJohn Roberts of the association said: \"It has obviously been very well\\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\\nhorn cut out of carpets.\\n\"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\\nnot get another refit for another year.\\n\"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a\\nlorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.\"\\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\\nwhitening.\\nMr Roberts added: \"The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\\n\"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\\ntake it away again because it was a major job.\"\\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\\n\"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\\nhas not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It\\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.\"\\nAn RCA spokesman said: \"Some people in the country are getting very\\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\\ndon't seem to be doing anything good.\"\\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: \"The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.\"\\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the\\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\\nmaybe me and you, too.\\nBut B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the\\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\\nproto-warriors in the background.\\nYou must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\\nMail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't\\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom\\nwe don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\\nBritish right) as \"Captain Hook\", in articles which usually call for his\\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\\nwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\\nto shut up.\\nBecause we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before\\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\\npersecution.\\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've\\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's\\nscoop.\\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were\\nmeant to do stuff like that.\\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\\ntrue - Hamza is not \"representative\" of British Muslims, as if British\\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\\nrevealed to be rather more \"representative\" than the list of those\\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an\\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.\\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\\ntime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't\\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,\\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\\nfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\\nrepellent.\\nAnd that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\\nis simply the pungency of his views.\\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\\nYou don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And\\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\\nup, therefore, won't make a difference.\\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Lupa\\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\\n \\n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\\n \\n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,\\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\\n \\n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\\n from video footage.\\n \\n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\\n that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.\\n \\n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\\n the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\\n \\n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not\\n grab their reins.\\n \\n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'\\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\\n Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\\n \\n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

That's a steppe too far [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        The Electronic Telegraph\\n\\n Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far\\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \\n \\n \\n So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\\n or sick of Sheffield.\\n \\n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\\n \\n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\\n with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\\n \\n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\\n side.\\n \\n \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant.\\n \\n \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\\n becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.\"\\n \\n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\\n \\n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\\n opening time in the nation's vodka shops.\\n \\n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\\n \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\\n life.\\n \\n \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\\n of whisky for kopecks.\"\\n \\n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\\n halfpenny in sterling.\\n \\n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\\n diehard alcoholics.\\n \\n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\\n \\n \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\\n off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.\"\\n \\n One or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. There\\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\\n Mongolian border.\\n \\n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\\n which they would like to live.\\n \\n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\".\\n \\n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\\n \\n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\\n \\n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\\n climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\\n solve itself\".\\n \\n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\\n \\n \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\\n amongst our citizens.\"\\n \\n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\\n preferred new home.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

According\\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of\\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\\npeople's shape.\\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\\ntaller than his French counterpart.\\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\\nadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.\\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\\nand 66.7 for women.\\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\\n1,047.2mm.\\nThe average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\\navailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\\naverage.\\nThe British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for\\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\\nopen ring pull cans.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established - there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants, but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created  much more easily within the petrochemical industry. Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world  war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants.  Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as  petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication  of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately  matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to  cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants. My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason. Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely  difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen, just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on, for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers. All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh  Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT [URL]http://news.com.com[/URL]  *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that  would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy  surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft   released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every  Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the  right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice   and Industry Canada  , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step  in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to  conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion  draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in  early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,  Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and  combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting  these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the  Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty  , which the country is in the  process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the  possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet  providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and  permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden  electronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In  most circumstances, a court order would be required for government  agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of  Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have  endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty  , which has  drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.  Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted  ,  or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist , a professor at the  University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the  justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems  weak. \"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the  changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to  make changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that's not a particularly convincing  argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,  make that case.\" Geist added that \"there's nothing in the document that indicates (new  powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant  number of cases where police have run into problems.\" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is  compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure  their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention  orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the  Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  , but it  applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. \"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and  Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical  capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national  security agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be  responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center   (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says  the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their  proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not  just Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals  only with computer data.\" EPIC opposes    the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and  does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs  of Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with  personal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The  implementation of such a database would presuppose that service  providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\"  the draft says. Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an  activist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\" \"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous  mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet  anonymously,\" Hosein said. A representative for George Radwanski  , Canada's privacy commissioner, said  the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on  the paper as it stands.\" Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca   no later than Nov. 15.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

The wheel is already patented in Australia; Melbourne man patents the wheel:    The sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents (pending or not) that's for very basic/general ideas; it's the current form of \"domainnapping\", and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents. \t/Tony --  # Per scientiam ad libertatem! // Through knowledge towards freedom! # # Genom kunskap mot frihet! =*= (c) 1999-2002 tony@svanstrom.com =*= #      perl -e'print$_{$_} for sort%_=`lynx -dump svanstrom.com/t`'\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at: [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too: [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] [URL]http://www.dudex.net[/URL] Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild. As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging for many releases now. I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these rpms do not work on (null). -- That's \"angle\" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}
