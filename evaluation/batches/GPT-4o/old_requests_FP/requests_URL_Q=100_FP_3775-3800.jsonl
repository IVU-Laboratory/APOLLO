Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. \\n\\nYou can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:\\n[URL]http://www.usatoday.com[/URL]\\nLiberia_x.htm[URL]http://www.unwire.org[/URL]\\n\\nBefore he was killed, my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA, and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to  be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged   his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund.\\n\\nMy decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $21.5Million,(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army.\\n\\nYou will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction.\\n\\n Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you.\\n\\nThis proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality.\\n\\nThanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently.\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMr. Adam Winpoe\\nFor the Family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from WebMail service at - [URL]http://www.ca-vn.net[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"BRA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am Mr,    Arbu  Mpula, the son of Dr.Henry  Mpula, who was \\nrecently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.\\nI got your contact through South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) in \\nJohannesburg, and I decided to solicit for your assistance. My late father \\nwas among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold  blood by \\nthe agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his \\nalleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled \\nby the white minority. Before his death he had taken me to  Johannesburg- \\nSouth Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 23.Million(Twenty three Million  \\nUnited States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he Foresaw \\nthe looming danger in Zimbabwe.\\nThe money was deposited in a metal box and declared as a personal effects \\nfor the use of some of his friends who were to arrive for the world \\nconference on racism scheduled to hold in South Africa from fromr 1st  \\nmarch, 2003.This money was given to my father by President.Robert Mugabe \\nhimself, for investment in South Africa when they were in good terms. The \\ndispute between my father and the President arose when the President \\nintroduced a new land reform-act, which adversely affected the rich white \\nfarmers and so  black farmers as well.    My father was vehemently opposed \\nto the \"modus operandis\"adopted by the government and publicly oppose it. \\nThis brought him in direct conflict with the president. To achieve his \\npurpose, the president used war veterans to plunder, loot and occupy all \\nfarms belonging to the white farmers and their black sympathizers. More than \\nFifty Farmers has lost their lives so far. Heads of governments from the \\nwest, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced there \\ncondemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently, South African Development \\nCommunity (S.A.D.C) has continuously Supported Mugabe's new land act, it is \\nagainst this background that I and my family who are currently Residing in \\nSouth Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign \\naccount. As the eldest Son of my Father, I am saddled with the \\nresponsibility Of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money Could \\nbe transferred without the knowledge of my Government who are tactically \\nfreezing our family Wealth and South Africa's government seems to be Playing \\nalong with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in \\nSouth Africa for fear of Encountering the same experience in future  since \\nboth Countries have almost the same political history.\\n\\nso, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment \\nhence I am seeking for an \"assylum\". As a businessperson that I entrusted my \\nFuture and that of my family into his hands, I must  Let you know that this \\ntransaction is 100% risk Free and the nature of your business does not \\nnecessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering You 20% of the \\ntotal sum, 75% for me and my family While 5%  will be mapped out for any \\nexpenses we may incurs during this transaction. We wish to invest our Money \\non commercial property based on your advice. Finally will demand for \\nassurance that you will not  sit on this money when it finally gets to your \\npersonal or company's account in your country.  If this proposal is \\nacceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above telephone, or \\nyou reply  through email.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    THANKS  AND  GOD  BLESS  YOU,\\n\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nMr; Arbu  Mpula,\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

Although personally,\\n\\nI keep this information secret to enable the whole plans and idea be \\nProfitable and successful during the time of execution, the said amount is \\nFifteen million three hundred thousand United States dollars(US$15.3m), as \\nit may interest you to know, I got your impressive information on my search \\nfor a reliable partner, I contacted you to be my partner and person to be \\nreliable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any \\nproblem.\\n\\nMeanwhile all the arrangement to put claim over this fund as the next of kin \\nto the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a \\nforeign account has been put in Place and directives and needed information \\nwill be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness \\nto assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity, \\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant and we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank.\\n\\nThis is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who \\nwill forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to \\nthe bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to \\nbe re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \\nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \\nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, on \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while 65% will be for \\nme, please you have been advised to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in \\nservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with \\nyou.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank Until you confirm \\nthe money in your account, and ask us to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further Investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in and all other necessary vital information will be send to you \\nwhen I hear from you.\\n\\nI suggest you get back to me As soon as possible and also include your \\npersonal phone/mobile and fax numbers for easy communication.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr. Usman Sankara\\nThe manager in charge of\\nAuditing department of\\nBank of Africa (B.O.A)\\nOuagadougou  Burkina Faso.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! \\n[URL]http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues, \\nthey were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for \\nthis mutual business relationship.\\nWe wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United \\nStates Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account.\\nThis fund was a residue of the over  invoiced contract bills awarded by us \\nfor the supply of equipment,hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items \\nrelating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and \\nother administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects.\\nThis DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the \\nattendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the \\ncooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the \\nOrganization.\\nWe arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different \\ncompanies from  different countries. It was our consensus to seek the \\nassistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to \\ntransfer this money out of Burkina Faso.\\nThis is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political \\nnature of this sub-region.The original contractors have been duly paid by \\nthe Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa, \\nOuaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa).\\nThrough our bankers - Societe Generale Banque. This balance is suspended in \\nthe escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We \\nintend to pay out this fund NOW as the  organization is winding up its \\nactivities and the coast has been achieved.\\nBased on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working \\nunder this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.\\nThis is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account \\nthat can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with \\nyour comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country.\\nIt is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of \\nthe entire sum as\\ncompensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to \\ndefray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.\\nThis transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord \\nus your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings;\\n1, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,\\n2, Your TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available)\\n3, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,\\n4, ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS.\\n5, ACCOUNT NUMBER.\\n6, SWIFT CODE.\\n7, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX \\nNUMBERS.\\nUpon the receipt of this information, the documents and approval with the  \\ntext will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the \\norganization for ratification and subsequent payment.\\nAs with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we \\nsolicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this \\nbusiness. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a Honorable business life \\nafterward.\\nThere are no risks involved regards in this business. I suggest you reply me \\nback for more intimate and details discussions.\\n\\nYours Faithfully.\\nMr. MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

Sule Alkali  [\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nDear Sir/Madam,\\n\\nI am Engr. Sule Alkali Director, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) Lagos, and have been delegated by my colleagues to seek the assistance of a reliable foreign company or individual into whose bank account we can transfer the sum of $36,560,000.00 USD (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand U.S. Dollars Only). This sum arose from a deliberate over-invoicing of contract bills of some contracts, which were awarded by us (MPNR) during the administration of the former military dictator late, General Sanni Abacha who died on 7th June 1998. Since then the money has been lying in our suspense current account of MPNR with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)(our Apex Bank). However, the current favorable political/Economical climate in the country now presents an opportunity for this money to be Transferred out of our country without any hitches - as we hope and believe it would be of mutual benefit to both of us.\\n\\nAlready, we have put in motion the complete machinery and modalities to enhance successful commencement and completion of this transaction and further actions will commence the moment we hear from you. We have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 20% of the total sum. My two colleagues and I shall take 70% while 10% is being mapped out for reimbursement of minor expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction. Conclusively, the nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate with us, and also an assurance that our Share of the funds will be given to us when the money arrives your account.\\n\\nMost importantly, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure a no risk situation on the side of both parties as this transaction is expected to be through within 10 to 14 working days. Please if the proposal is acceptable to you, contact me immediately through this email address sulealkali10@netscape.net However, if you are not interested, kindly let us know and do not disclose the content of this letter to any third party. Kindly include your private Telephone and Fax numbers while replying for easy and effective communication.\\n\\nThe trust we have reposed in you at this point is enormous and cannot be over-emphasized. We await your prompt response to this proposal, so we can commence immediate release proceedings with our good positions.\\n\\nBest Regards.\\n\\nEngr.
