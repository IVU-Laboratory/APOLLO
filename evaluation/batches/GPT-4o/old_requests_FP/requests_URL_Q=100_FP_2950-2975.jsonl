I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. LikeI said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner.\\n\\n \\n\\nI use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Lagos who passed on,so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $10.5 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years.From my investigation,I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev a Russian big time Oildealer, who unfortunately lost his life in the Yak-40jetliner on March 9, 2000. You will read more news about the crash on visiting these site; \\n\\n[URL]http://www.amarillonet.com[/URL] and\\n\\n[URL]http://news.1chinastar.com[/URL]\\n\\n \\n\\nI have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to claim the  money as next of kin to the late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev meaning that no one is aware of the account. I can not directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.I am seeking your co -operation to present you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together,so as to give you more details.\\n\\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality.\\n\\n \\n\\nI wait your urgent response.\\n\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\n\\nMr.Henry Carr\\n\\n\\n\\n- Henry Carr\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am writting to seek your coperation over this business deal.  In my department,\u00a0 I discovered an abandoned sum of$15million USD(Fifteen million US dollars)only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took place in Kenya,East Africa,the Late DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY,a citizen of Atlanta,United States of America but naturalised in Burkinafaso,WestAfrica and\u00a0 contractor with ECOWAS,(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) .  \u00a0 Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released\u00a0 unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis businness proposal to you and release the money to\u00a0 you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could\u00a0 go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.  \u00a0 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclamed after four years, the money will betransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a\u00a0 foreign citizen\u00a0 to stand as the next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 30 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expences incured during the business and 60 % would be for me.There after I will come over to your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.  \u00a0 Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased,indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted .  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the bank of africa. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is stricly confidential and i will use my position in this Bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund.

I am writting to seek your coperation over this business deal.  In my department,\u00a0 I discovered an abandoned sum of$15million USD(Fifteen million US dollars)only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took place in Kenya,East Africa,the Late DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY,a citizen of Atlanta,United States of America but naturalised in Burkinafaso,WestAfrica and\u00a0 contractor with ECOWAS,(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) .  \u00a0 Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released\u00a0 unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis businness proposal to you and release the money to\u00a0 you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could\u00a0 go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.  \u00a0 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclamed after four years, the money will betransfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a\u00a0 foreign citizen\u00a0 to stand as the next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 30 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expences incured during the business and 60 % would be for me.There after I will come over to your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.  \u00a0 Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased,indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted .  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the bank of africa. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is stricly confidential and i will use my position in this Bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.  Trusting to hear from you immediately.

I am MR Gabriel Mukanabe THE ASSISTANT TO THE AUDITOR GENERAL AMALGAMATED BANKS OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA) and a close confidant of one of the South-African most powerful family. The wife of former top Government official, a Gold magnet {OriginalOwner of GRUGGER GOLD CO.}, i.e. late Dr BAMUNGA SANGO MBEKI, former Junior Minister of Mines and Power , Republic ofSouth-Africa.Unfortunately, he died of heart attack soon after handing over because the new Government wanted to probe his activitieswhile in office for financial misappropriations. Presently, all their foreign and local count was frozen and their assets confiscated. The wife, who is now on her sick bed helplessly since her husbands death with her only son to look after, wishes to move out of South-Africa the sum of USD$75 million . She wishes to invest the a for mentioned sum on real estate property/viable inves!\\ntments overseas. For obvious reasons, my client does not want to place this fund with established financial institution with the family name forsecurity reasons. It is her desire that the deal be handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or Government. She has therefore empowered me to find and negotiate for a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can assist us by using his/her name in moving the money to a foreign safe account and who can assist to invest the fund properly for the family. If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client and the family, I shall release the sum of $75 USD[seventy five million united states dollars] to you if you meet my requirements.The money is available safe with a private security company coded and lodged in with a fictitious name. Upon a favorable response from you, I shall let you know the steps involve. Your commission shall be down payment of 25% of the total sum, and annual 10% of the after ta!\\nx returns on investment for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the terms shall be re-negotiated. If you are capable and willing to participate in this \\ntransaction contact me through ga_m@epatra.com \\nIF FOR ANY REASON YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED AT MOMENT TO \\nUNDERTAKE THIS DEAL,LET ME KNOW ON TIME SO AS TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE\\nARRANGEMENT.BECAUSE I WILL NOT CONACT ANOTHER PERSON UNTILL I HEAR FROM YOU.\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMR Gabriel Mukanabe\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________\\nGet Paid...

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

I have B.SC in\\nPublic Administration and I work with GLOBAL SECURITY\\n& FINANCE LTD. I  have now developed the interest in\\nhaving a business investment outside Nigeria without\\nmy employers knowing about it. Hence I contacted you\\nfor friendship and business relationship.\\n\\nThe fund in question proposed for this project is\\nUS$14.8million(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred\\nThousand Dollars Only), which I will like you to\\nreceive it on my behalf and to invest it in your\\nbusiness or in any business that you think will be\\nprofitable in your country.\\n\\nPlease Note: This fund have been under a suspense\\naccount pending the time it will be claimed by the\\nowner. It came as a result of a multi-natinal company\\nthat we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some\\nyears ago and after the contract, the company got paid\\nand went back to their country leaving behind this\\nover-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.\\n\\nNow the time has come for me to process and move the\\nfund out for investment, but I can not do it on my own\\nsince I am still working with the Global Security &\\nFinanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that I\\ncan use you or your company to process the release of\\nthe fund as if you are reciving a payment of an\\nexecuted contract.\\n\\nPlease let me know about yourself/company and also let\\nme know if you can be able to receive the money on my\\nbehalf and invest it in your company or any good and\\nprofitable business in your country without exposing\\nme, so as to give you all the details needed to make\\nthe money transferred to you. \\n\\nYour share will be 40% for your assistance, while I\\nwill take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses\\nthat will be incurred in the cause of transfer.\\n\\nPlease write back if only you know you are capable\\nenough to execute this project with me.\\n\\nPlease this transaction requires utmost\\nconfidentiality.
