I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you.I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance.I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account.I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect the transfer accordingly.\\n \\nIs rest assured that the modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the successful transfer of the funds.So, you will be absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email with following details: \\n1.

Though I know that a transaction of this\\nmagnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring\\nyou that all will be well at the end of the day. There is no doubt that\\ntrust conceptually is a conundrum which leadsitself to deferring\\ninterpretation, we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this\\ntransaction.\\n\\nI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department\\nof BANK OF AFRICA(BOA). I came to know you in my private search for a\\nreliable and reputable person to handle this Confidential Transaction,\\nwhich involves thetransfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account\\nrequiring maximum confidence.\\n\\nI am writing to you, following the impressive information received about\\nyou from the chambers of commerce. I believed that you are capable and\\nreliable to champion this business opportunity. In my department we\\ndiscovered an abandoned sum of $30m US dollars (Thirty million US\\ndollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who\\ndied along with his entire family On August 23, 2000 through Gulf Air\\nFlight 72 with Airbus A320 crashed off, killing all 143 people on board\\nand you can view the site for more\\ndetails:[URL]http://www-tech.mit.edu[/URL]\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next\\nof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it\\nunless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased\\nas indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that\\nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the\\nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make\\nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of\\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement\\nsince nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\\nBank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained\\nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank\\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in\\nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner\\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for\\nexpenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me and my\\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for\\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as\\narranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of\\nthe deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your\\nprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and\\nlocation where in the money will be remitted.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of\\nthe application.

So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be\\nthe onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of\\nthe countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in\\nNigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for\\nsecurityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ;\\nfortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to\\nairship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery\\nwe willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office,\\nbut for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are\\nunable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you.\\nHere inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means\\nin whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this\\ndecision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of\\nthe totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in\\ncourse ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family. We wish to invest this fund in\\nyourcountry ,this transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded all\\nnecessaryarrangments before contacting you.\\n\\n\\nWe expect your favourable response, indicate your private Telephone and\\nFax numbersfor easy\\ncomunication. Upon comfirming your readiness to assist we shall get all\\nnecessarydocument including the certificate of Deposit made in your name as it was\\nmerelydeposited by my father as family valuables.\\n\\nThanks For your Co-operation,\\n\\nWe expect to here from you .\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nPrince DENNIS MALANGE SAVIMBI.\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------\\nWWW.COM - Where The Web Begins!
