Then I knew it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my  ~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded state, etc.  \tI have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at 1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!) \tSearching for 'unseen' in that file found this section: NEW: exmh.Exmh NAME: exmh CLASS: Exmh NEW: unseen.UnseenWin NAME: unseen CLASS: UnseenWin DESKTOP: 0 RES: 1600 1200 WH: 114 173 XY: 1655 150 0 0 LAYER: 4 STICKY: 1 SKIPTASK: 0 SKIPWINLIST: 0 SKIPFOCUS: 0 SHADE: 2 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE \tI changed: XY: 1655 150 0 0  \tto  XY: 1455 150 0 0\tso it would reappear in my viewable space, restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo! There was my window!  \tI quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so: NEW: exmh.Exmh NAME: exmh CLASS: Exmh NEW: unseen.UnseenWin NAME: unseen CLASS: UnseenWin BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE \tCompletely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when shading.) \tHmm. Weird.  \tAnyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 6.5.2 Comment: Don't know what PGP is?

Worth FoRKing for the archives, too.\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nJuly 28, 2002\\nVenture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off\\nBy LYNNLEY BROWNING\\n\\nThe venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like\\na brawling barroom.\\n\\nVenture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly\\nhard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or\\noriginal backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for\\nmoney, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are\\neven suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are\\nwiping out the value of their previous investments.\\n\\n\"People are playing hardball,\" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at\\nCharles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.\\n\\nThe bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out\\nmany venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks\\nand limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,\\nventure capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,\\n\"private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture\\ncapitalists that we have seen in 20 years,\" said Steven E. Bochner, a\\nsecurities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,\\nwho represents venture firms.\\n\\nIn the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two\\noptions. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits\\nand receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into\\ncommon stock when the private company held an initial public offering or\\nwas sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired\\ncompanies, they usually chose No. 2.\\n\\nBut with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers\\nand acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast\\nare increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This \"double dip,\"\\nknown as \"participating preferred,\" leaves far less potential wealth for a\\ncompany's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also\\nnegotiating more deals with heightened \"liquidation preferences,\" in which\\nstart-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three\\ntimes over.\\n\\nPreviously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump\\nsum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when\\nthe new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,\\nor the hiring of a particular chief executive.\\n\\nThey are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that\\npermit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who\\nmight dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate\\ndepartment at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.\\nBorden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular\\nventure capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those\\nbackers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.\\n\\nENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists\\nhave been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the\\nprices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less\\nwhen it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a \"full\\nratchet,\" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.\\nBut it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's\\noriginal investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the\\ncompany for a song.\\n\\n\"If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get\\ncrushed\" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,\\ngeneral partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,\\nbased in Wellesley Hills, Mass.\\n\\nConsider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three\\nrounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110\\nmillion from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia\\nCapital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of\\nGoldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at\\nmore than $180 million.\\n\\nLast month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul\\nVenture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the\\ncompany for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only\\n$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But\\nmost of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,\\nleaving almost no value for existing investors.\\n\\nDespite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors\\nchose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,\\n\"there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous\\ninvestments,\" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.\\n\"We were all completely washed out\" in the last round, said the investor,\\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nThere is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.\\nVenture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are\\nprivate and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities\\nlawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.\\n\"At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,\" said\\nMark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a\\ntrade group based in Arlington, Va.\\n\\nThe shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture\\ncapitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall\\nStreet's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own\\ninvestors and to justify their management fees.\\n\\nVenture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new\\ncompany. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent\\ninvestor. \"We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the\\nbenefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,\" said Todd Dagres,\\na general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.\\n\\nSome entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no\\nother way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the\\ninvestors, whom they call \"vulture capitalists,\" bent on picking the meat\\noff a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists \"want to\\ntake advantage of you,\" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike\\nForce Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,\\nN.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months\\nbecause they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales\\nmilestones.\\n\\nGeorge J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New\\nYork that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms\\nhad even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured\\nwith receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned\\nthem all down.\\n\\nNOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture\\nfirms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the\\ncompanies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.\\n\\nIn one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley\\nfirm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial\\nthis month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial\\nservices concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before\\nthe Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million\\nround that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to\\nraise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half\\nthe company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,\\nunspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the\\nmoney. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware\\njudge threw out last week.\\n\\nSuch friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated\\nlike a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one\\nanother. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in\\ntighter markets, \"there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,\" said Mr.\\nBochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. \"There's going to be much more\\nlitigation like this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Companies that have taken on way too much debt can\\nscrew their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by\\ndeclaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,\\nit becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on\\ntoo much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...\\n\\nIn my next life, I'm coming back as a corporation.  They get all the\\nperks. :)\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nA Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected\\nBy PHILIP SHENON\\n\\nWASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday\\nby Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the\\nHouse and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for\\nAmericans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.\\n\\nAfter the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun\\nto receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to\\nfile bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.\\n\\n\"I've had plenty of calls this morning,\" said Gary F. Weltmann, a\\nconsumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. \"And I'm telling people that\\nthey need to take action now.\"\\n\\nMarty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was\\n\"getting ready for the onslaught.\"\\n\\n\"I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,\"\\nhe said.\\n\\nThe White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,\\nwhich was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in\\nthe Senate next week. \\n\\n\"The president looks forward to signing that,\" said Ari Fleischer, the\\nWhite House spokesman. \"That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support\\nfor good reasons.\" \\n\\nThe bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate\\nconference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more\\nthan a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday\\nafter agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final\\nobstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters\\nfrom using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a\\nresult of clinic protests.\\n\\nThe bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card\\nand banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the\\nbankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to\\npay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up\\n19 percent from 2000.\\n\\n\"This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our\\nbankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one\\nwhile cracking down on those who don't,\" said Representative F. James\\nSensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House\\nJudiciary Committee.\\n\\nCritics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a\\ngift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign\\ncontributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do\\nharm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost\\njobs, poor health or divorce.\\n\\nThe bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,\\nwhich comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive\\naccounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of\\nthe same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for\\nthe bankruptcy bill.\\n\\n\"The timing couldn't be worse,\" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative\\ndirector of the Consumer Federation of America. \"It takes a lot of gall\\nfor Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are\\nconcerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky.\" \\n\\nSenator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of\\nthe bill, said today that \"it boggles the mind that at a time when\\nAmericans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need\\nof protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major\\nfinancial safety net in our society for the middle class.\"\\n\\nBankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and\\nmiddle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take\\nthem years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free \"fresh start\"\\nthat many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.\\n\\nRecent studies have shown that the average American filing for\\nbankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average\\nof about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last\\nyear showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that\\nwas six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had\\nmedical debts exceeding $1,000.\\n\\n\"I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,\"\\nsaid Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the\\nBankruptcy Center. \"But there are honest, hard-working folks who are\\nreally going to be affected by these changes.\"\\n\\nThe bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes\\nin their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the\\nfederal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their\\nunsecured debts, like credit card bills.\\n\\nDebtors with an income above the state median would be barred from\\nfiling under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead\\nunder Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be\\nrepaid over time under the court-administered plan.\\n\\nMr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would \"hurt\\na lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.\"\\n\\n\"My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and\\nthey've just got heavy debt,\" he said. \"You can always find some\\ncircumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and\\ngot themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old\\npoor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that\\nthe credit card companies make to Congress.\"\\n\\n\\n----\\naDaM@XeNT.CoM -- .sig double play!\\n\\n\\nAt its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now\\nremain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few\\nniches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is\\nfile sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative\\neconomic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording\\nindustry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer\\nauctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail\\nmay have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely\\nthey failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the\\npublic's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the\\nart has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found\\nsatisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter\\nunwritten.\\n  -- Gene Kan, [URL]http://story.news.yahoo.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\nXML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have\\nthe ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT\\npolicies such as security, routing, performance, management,\\ntransformation, and connection provisioning.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        two seperate projects this weekend.  first mod_gzip which is an apache module to speed up serving static and dynamic mime(text/.*) web content. the second is the compaq smart array configs for linux. before i go on much more i'll cover the following bits: the server is running redhat 7.3 linux with all the updates on a compaq dl380. the client is running the same on a compaq laptop.  pretty much everything is stock redhat 7.3 - and i'm consciously trying to stick to that. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ mod_gzip:          there's a tutorial on linux.ie for it (thanks donnacha) but since i'm     not an apache person this only got me part of the way.  step by step,     this is what i did: \t# cd /root \t# wget [URL]http://www.remotecommunications.com[/URL] \t# gunzip mod_gzip.c.gz \t# apxs -ic mod_gzip.c          that should compile and install fine, so add the following to     your apache configs.  i've included comments to explain where they     should go.  my apache config is split among many files (which is     why i didn't use the -a flag to apxs). \t# put this after the last LoadModule line \tLoadModule gzip_module        /usr/lib/apache/mod_gzip.so \t# put this after the last LoadModule line \tAddModule mod_gzip.c \t# this just needs to go below the obove two lines. \t \t    mod_gzip_on                         Yes \t    mod_gzip_minimum_file_size          300 \t    mod_gzip_maximum_file_size          0 \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.htm$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.html$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.txt$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.php$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.php3$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.php4$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               file    \\.pl$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               mime    text/.* \t    mod_gzip_item_include               mime    httpd/unix-directory \t    mod_gzip_item_include               handler ^perl-script$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               handler ^server-status$ \t    mod_gzip_item_include               handler ^server-info$ \t    mod_gzip_item_exclude               file    \\.css$ \t    mod_gzip_item_exclude               file    \\.js$ \t    mod_gzip_item_exclude               mime    ^image/.* \t    mod_gzip_dechunk                    yes \t    # mod_gzip_min_http                 1000 \t    mod_gzip_temp_dir                   /tmp \t    mod_gzip_keep_workfiles             No \t    LogFormat \"%h \\\"%f\\\" %{mod_gzip_result}n %{mod_gzip_input_size}n %{mod_gzip_output_size}n %{mod_gzip_compression_ratio}npct.\" mod_gzip_logs \t    CustomLog logs/compression_log mod_gzip_logs \t     finally, poke apache: \t# service httpd reload     and after you've viewed some pages and check     /var/log/httpd/compression_log in order to see if it's working.     if you have /server-info avilable you should see that mod_gzip     is loaded.  a compressed line and a non-compressed line might look     like this: \troo \"/.../ssl_glossary.html\" OK 15092 4726 69pct. \troo \"/.../ssl_template.head-num-7.gif\" DECLINED:EXCLUDED 0 0 0pct. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ compaq smart array config:   (WARNING: YOU NEED A JVM FOR YOUR BROWSER)     i searched on google for \"compaq smart array configuration linux\" and     got a slew of hits.  one of them was a click away from this page: \t[URL]http://www.compaq.com[/URL]     i downloaded the rpm.  installed it. and ran the server per the     instructions.  note, the -R enables remote connections.  if you're     running the browser locally, run it without the -R and connect     to localhost. \tcpqacuxe -R     i found that galeon didn't work.  mozilla did.  i suspect it's because     pop-ups are disabled in galeon config, but i might be wrong.  it uses     java which is slow and memory hungry on this laptop.  feel free to     try galeon with pop-ups enabled if you want to.     so, point mozilla at http://yourserver:2301/ .  login as     administrator/administrator and change your password.  then go back     to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards     the bottom.  configure your array as you want (i had to add a disk).     save your changes, and exit.  to stop the server, just do this: \tcpqacuxe -stop     in my case the drive was now accessible.  i started the process of     making the file systems by partitioning the drive.  i knew what     it would be called, but a grep for ida on the output of dmesg     confirmed it. \tfdisk /dev/ida/c0d1     and from there i built the filesystems and so on. hope this helps some folks, kevin --  Kevin Lyda - kevin@doolin.com Lead Programmer Doolin Technologies --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie [URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.

That's my understanding of how it works anyway. > > John > > Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2 That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux: Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel  platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a  higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture. Therefore:     export CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=\" &&     CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS This is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it. So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations  that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems  the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by  even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel. I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching  GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try  using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user  apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not  prepared to go to this length. For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object  pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it  and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm  still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been  several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.
