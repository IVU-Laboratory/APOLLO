[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Attn: The President /ceo \\n\\nDear, \\n\\nBy way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. \\n\\nSince the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. \\n\\nBased on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . \\n\\nBy this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to \\nunderstand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. \\n\\nTrusting to hear from you, I remain \\n\\nRespectfully yours, \\n\\nMr. Idris Umar. \\n\\nNB:FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE REVERT BACK TO ME VIA \\nTHIS MY ALTERNATIVE MAILBOX:(idrisumar71@rediffmail.com) \\nFIND MY CELL NUMBERS 234 80 33338093. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________\\nGO.com Mail                                    \\nGet Your Free, Private E-mail at [URL]http://mail.go.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am Barrister Robert Beaud, the legal adviser to late \\nMR. MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the \\nUnited Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December \\nduring the Tsunami disaster last year \\n(2004).[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] these \\ncouple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their \\nlife to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot \\nof landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As \\ntheir legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol \\nHall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they \\ndedicated their wealth to God. \\n\\nAccording to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry \\nfor the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the \\nassets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He \\ngave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the \\nwork of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a \\nmatter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two \\ntrunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the \\nSecurity Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore \\nthey registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the \\nsecurity company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold \\nBars. \\n\\nAs a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to \\ndo what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund \\nto the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by \\nthe owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked \\nGod to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the \\nchosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came \\nacross your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a \\nChristian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for \\nthings that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the \\nSecurity Company where they deposited the consignments that contained \\nthe fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security \\ncompany is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the \\nshores of my country. \\n\\nDear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly \\nand wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me \\nwith the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) \\nYour prompt response will be highly appreciated. \\n\\nYours in Christ. \\n\\nBarrister Robert Beaud. \\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.  Note, the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. Through well-secured channels,I have the ability to flit away the funds into a bank in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds of this nature.And to further obliterate any atom of trace to the fund, once in The Cayman Islands,I will relocate the funds to France through same well-secured established channel. Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds from France. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds in your name.And we share the funds.  Kindly provide me with your full names, address, and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to France securely, from where you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 percent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.  You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:  [URL]www.swissbankclaims.com[/URL]  [URL]www.avotaynu.com[/URL]  [URL]www.icheic.org[/URL]  [URL]www.livingheirs.com[/URL]  [URL]www.wiesenthal.com[/URL]   The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement. I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.

For\\ninstance, Nelson Mandela was compensated with being the first president of  \\nthe Republic of South Africa; Richard Parkes was appointed the manager  of  \\nShell and BP South Africa petroleum and refinery (S.A.P.R), Jeff Radebe  was \\n  appointed the Minister of public Enterprises and Trevor Manual was  \\nappointed  the Finance Minister.\\n\\nIn fact, I got your contact / credibility from South African  information  \\nexchange assisted by the south African Chamber of Commerce and Industry  \\nwhere I however read your company profile believing in its reputable  \\ncapability as regards my intensive purposes to you.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, I have accumulated sufficiently USD$5 MILLION(Five  \\nMillion United States Dollars) by virtue of my position in the office  as a  \\nsenior civil servant in the South African Gold and Diamond mining  company  \\nKrugersdrop.

I am afraid that the\\ngovernment of South Africa might start to investigate on\\ncontracts awarded from 1998 to date.

As soon as you have\\nconfirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son\\nwith my Attorney to come to your country to\\ndiscuss on business investments.\\n\\nFor your assistance, I am offering you 5 Million (Five\\nmillion United States Dollars Only) However, you have to\\nassure me and also be ready to\\ngo into agreement with\\nme that you will not elope with my fund.\\n\\nIf you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of\\nurgency send me an email.Due to my sensitive position in the\\nSouth African Government, I would not WANT you to call me on\\nphone or send a fax to me. All correspondence must be by\\nemail to my private email:(shubanga-suzzy@hotmail.com)\\n\\nIf you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine\\nand okay by me.\\nHis chambers will be representing my interest\\nwith you. if you show\\ninterest in assisting me, i will foward\\nhis contact to you and yours to him.\\nI would also like you to give me your contact address i.e.\\ntelephone, fax and whatever other means of communication of which to\\nreach you,\\nto enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to\\ntime.\\n\\nPlease I do not need to remind you of the need for\\nabsolute\\nConfidentiality if this transaction must succeed.

My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation/associate,and all etiquette shall be done in accordance with the rule of law, Iwillsimply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, If you\\nfindyourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,through this email account sirqinwang@netscape.net. It is necessarytoinform you thatunder no condition should you contact me via official channels\\nI await your response.\\nYours Sincerely,\\nQin Li Wang\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
