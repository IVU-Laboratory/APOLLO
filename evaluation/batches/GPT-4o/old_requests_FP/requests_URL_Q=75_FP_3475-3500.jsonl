I am (Trevor Gumel\u00a0 Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist   search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this busin  ness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u2019t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fu  nd to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97,and reply me On This E-mail\u00a0Address---genic2k@hotmail.com\u00a0immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your\u2019s faithfully,\u00a0Trevor Gumel\u00a0\u00a0(Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Jackson Khumalo\\nJOHANNESBURG-SOUTH AFRICA\\nPrivate email: jackkhumalo@sify.com   \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nATTN: PRESIDENT/\\nCEO,\\n\\n\\nDIRECTOR, DELIVERY/OPERATIONS\\nRE: TRANSFER OF US$25 MILLION\\nFOR INVESTMENT.\\n\\nI am Mr. Jackson khumalo, the Director of Delivery/Operations in a security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa especially top government officials and military leaders in the world. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on \\nBusiness proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. To be explicit and straight to the point, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's \\nVault for safekeeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a\\nconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide\\nto contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his \\nConsignment had accumulated I discovered that our client was the former Late Prime\\n\\nMinister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri,\\n\\n                     PROFILE\\nof the Late Minister of Lebanon: Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri {November 1,\\n1944  February 14, 2005} married to Nazek Audi  Hariri, was a Lebanese\\nself  made billionaire and business tycoon, and was former \\nPrime Minister of Lebanon {1992  1998 and 2000  2004} before his late\\nresignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg\\nof C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George\\nHotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to\\n\\n{[URL]http://www.hariri.info[/URL]}.\\n\\nAfter in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or \\nAids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of\\ncuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client deposited\\nin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box that\\nwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained a\\nconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to\\nabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have been\\nnursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the\\nforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his\\ncountry while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my conviction\\nthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our\\nclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this\\nmoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I \\nFound that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).\\n\\nFinally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist\\nme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for\\nimmediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously be\\nentitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply\\nconfirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I \\nWill immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and\\ntransfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.\\nThis transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute\\nconfidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail\\n\\n(jackkhumalo@sify.com)\\n\\nI await your most prompt\\nresponse.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr. Jackson khumalo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Dear Friend,  I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b  roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about. [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] It is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my lawyer who is base in London Uk to finalize this transaction with you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \u7423sqla}IA{iql\u741aGkester_jone_s@yahoo.com.hk Sir/Madam, I am kester jones  An Accountant with Unity Trust Bank Plc London UK. I got contact from British Chamber of Commerce  Industries Foreign Trade Department, On the cost of my research for a Foreign partner who can assist me for urgent and  confidential business Relationship.   On January 7, 1996, An America Oil consultant/contractor with the submit oil company London UK, Engr. Kim Changho made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at ?5,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) in my Bank upon maturity. I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from one of their staff in The submit oil company that Engr. Kim Changho is among the passengers that perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our customer.. On further investigation, i found out that he died without making a  WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Kim Changho did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of ?5,000,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the British law, at the expiration of (10)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund Consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to late Engr. Kim Changho, So that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an  Attorney for the Drafting and Notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour for the transfer. Any Bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 55%  for me and 40% for you, While we keep 5% for  local and international expenses we might incure in the cost of this transaction, Take Note: There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Accountant guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately, upon your response,i shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please if this proposal satisfies you , upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me the following to enable me start the process of the fund into your bank account: You shall read more about the crash on visiting this:[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] 1.

While a large part of our share will also be used to help charity organizations.\\n\\nWe have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don\u0092t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. \\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. \\n\\nYou should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. \\n\\nYour\u0092s faithfully, \\n\\nJoe Kekabu (Esq.)\\nFROM (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.\\nGOD BLESSINGS,PROTECTIONS AND GUIDIANCE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.  \\n\\nPOST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Bill made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500,000.00(TEN Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill and har husband and their only son. died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:[URL]http://www.marsearthconnection.com[/URL]\\nOn further investigation, I found out that she died without making a  WILL and attempts to trace har next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to AFRICAN law, at the expiration of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill so that the fruit of this old woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will  be set aside for expenses incured during the business . There is no risk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your responses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank\\naccount(:1) The beneficiary's name(.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.\\nAwaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:johnduf1@post.cz and johnduf2320021@mail2world.com or call\\nme on my private telephone number: +221-5124859\\n\\nThanks and God bless,\\n\\nMr JOHN DUF\\nMANAGER:\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)\\nDAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. \\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON 31ST OCTOBER 1999 IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN ORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEEP THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF AND PARTNERS TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS  USD7.2M(SEVEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE INFORMATION THROUGH THE BURKINA FASO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON FOREIGN BUSINESS RELATIONS HERE IN BURKINA FASO. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST US AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATED BANK ACCOUNT. I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR ME. PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP \"TOP SECRET\" AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU. I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER NECESSARY VITAL INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU. PLEASE INDICATE YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER WHEN REPLYING THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL PREFERABLY THROUGH MY ONLY CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL ADDRESS:(jeff_murd@yahoo.fr) OR CALL ME ON MY ABOVE DIRECT TELEPHONE NUMBER 0022678037693. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED, PLEASE ALSO INDICATE SO THAT IT WILL ENABLE ME TO CONTACT ANOTHER FOREIGN PARTNER WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO CARRY OUT THIS DEAL.A SWIFT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL WILL BE APPRECIATED.THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVE YOUR EMAIL.

Difficulties encountered in efforts to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate this search for someone to assist me. \\nMy name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money. \\nTo save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Allstate Trust Bank\\n16\\\\17, Oyin Jolayemi Street,\\nVictoria Island Lagos \\nWebsite: [URL]http://www.allstatesbanking.com[/URL]\\n\\nDear Sir, \\n\\nI hope this will not meet you as a surprise, as I know that I have not \\n\\nheard any previous corressponding with you, but have taken interest in \\n\\nyou, as a result of my choice of investment. I am Okpara Addey, \\n\\nManaging Director, Corporate Audit ,Allstate Trust Bank, Nigeria. This \\n\\nis an urgent and very confidential business proposition. I am seeking \\n\\nyour assistance here to enable me transfer and  invest the sum of $24M \\n\\nin LANDED PROPERTIES there in  your country. The source of these funds \\n\\nis as follows:\\n\\nOn June 6, 2002,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian \\n\\nInstitute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Steve Warren, made a numbered \\n\\ntime(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at \\n\\nUS$24,000,000.00,(Twenty-Four Million Dollars) in my branch. \\n\\nUpon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \\n\\nbut got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we \\n\\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian Institute of \\n\\nMining and Metallurgy, that Mr.Steve Warren died from an automobile \\n\\naccident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without \\n\\nmaking a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. \\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Steve \\n\\nWarren did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official \\n\\ndocuments, including his Bank Deposit documents in my Bank. This sum of \\n\\nUS$24,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. \\n\\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. \\n\\nAccording to the Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, \\n\\nthe money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody \\n\\napplies to claim the fund. \\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that, since Mr.Steve Warren is a \\n\\nForeigner, I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of \\n\\nthe money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you \\n\\nbecause I as a public servant, I cannot operate a foreign account, and \\n\\nmoreso, my choice of investment, which is one of the reasons why I \\n\\nwould want you to assist me, as I will need your assistance to invest \\n\\nthese funds in the Real Estate  business, to which which any PROFIT \\n\\nRETURN will be shared under an agreed percentage between the both of \\n\\nus, outside the normal percentage to be agreed on for your assistance.\\n\\nI want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to \\n\\nclaim them. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your \\n\\nfull names and address, as well as phone and fax numbers,so that all  \\n\\nthe neccessary document can be  prepared , which will put you in place \\n\\nas the beneficiary of the funds.\\n\\nThe money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me \\n\\nand 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done in \\n\\naccordance to the law of the land and this guarantees the successful \\n\\nexecution of this transaction. \\n\\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address \\n\\nat: amokpara007@yahoo.co.uk, and upon your response,I shall provide \\n\\nyou with more details and relevant documents that will help you \\n\\nunderstand the transaction. \\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this \\n\\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\n\\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in Real Estate  within your \\n\\ncountry. This is the major reason why I have contacted you.\\n\\nDue to the nature and confidentiality in this Transaction, it should be \\n\\naccorded all the neccesary confidentiality required, as my job will be \\n\\nat stake in the event of any eventuality.   I hope that this will meet \\n\\nyou in a good state of mind.\\n\\nI will pause for now, as I await your urgent response\\n\\nRegards.\\n\\nOkpara Addey\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
