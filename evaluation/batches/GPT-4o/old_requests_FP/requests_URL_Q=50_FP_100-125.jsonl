So, if you have installed X, you have OpenGL.

It was one of the worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200 crew members survived. Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic story a startling new twist. It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made the sinking possible. Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58 surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And, they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds. Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six torpedoes sent it to the bottom. \"It was sheer chance,\" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. \"Without that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the cruiser, especially at that distance.\" With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a university honors course called \"Astronomy in Art, History and Literature.\" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the moon in military and other encounters. Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright star in van Gogh's \"White House at Night.\" He and some students went to Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was completed in June 1890. Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed, and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then identified the \"star.\" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June had occupied that part of the sky. A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the middle of the month that year. Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the opening of \"Hamlet,\" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the \"star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns.\" From the guards' description, the season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars. Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star, for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia, creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the source of some of his best-known plays. Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other astronomy-based sleuthing. Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic \"Moon and Half Dome.\" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at 4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960. Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of \"Moon and the Half Dome\" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual moon and the Half Dome. Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly rapid movement of the moon described in \"The Merchant's Tale\" occurred in April 1389. And in \"The Franklin's Tale,\" Chaucer's description of the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur astronomer. Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride, how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that, while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat. Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining \"the tide that failed\" in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943. Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with drafts of at least four feet, to pass. But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, \"the ocean just sat there,\" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600 yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun fire from the Japanese. Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the military planners were aware that they had to contend with a \"neap\" tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes water levels to deviate less. But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed and the marines in trouble. \"I'm not in the least blaming the planners,\" Dr. Olson said, explaining that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been applied to the waters at Tarawa. Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, \"We can calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.\" Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. \"I have thought about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,\" he says, \"and that has made my life as a scientist much richer.\" [URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov  ----- From: Vladimir Katalov  Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov  Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 [URL]http://news.com.com[/URL] By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PT WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system. In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it \"could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years\" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system. HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books. If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that \"is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection\" of copyrighted works. On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias \"Phased,\" said in the message: \"Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.\" That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

As a Mets fan since 1962, I\\nthink it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan\\nHoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there\\nisn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I\\ntotally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money.\\nThe site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major\\nLeague Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for\\nfree to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over\\nby MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves\\nbased on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another\\nside to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please\\nremember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this\\nwebsite is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.\\n![]([URL]http://www.scripting.com[/URL]  \\n  \\nPostscript: I've been emailing with Bryan, and asked if the local NY press has\\ntaken up his cause.

Dump examines\\nfiles in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and\\ncopies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The\\nrestore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a\\nfull backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be\\nlayered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may\\nalso be restored from full or partial backups.\\n\\nChanges: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented\\nthe use of a remote tape drive. \\n\\nLicense: BSD License\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[021] - DungeonMaker 2.01 \\n  by henningsen ([URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:22\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout: The DungeonMaker is a program/class library that generates random\\ndungeons and labyrinths using artificial life methods.

In addition to\\nthe standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:\\nsequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems\\n(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the\\nstring). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable\\nrules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of\\ngenerations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial\\nintelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal\\npatterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle\\ncommands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other\\nliving things, or even music. \\n\\nLicense: GNU General Public License (GPL)\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[047] - LM-Solve 0.5.6 (Development)\\n  by Shlomi Fish ([URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 01:55\\n\\nGames/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games\\n\\nAbout: LM-Solve is a solver for several types of the puzzles present on\\nthe Logic Mazes site.

A configuration is sequence of directives, each\\ndirective consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a\\nstring or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax\\nhas a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with\\narbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides\\ncomplex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,\\nhexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++\\nand shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a\\nconfiguration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,\\nand optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.  \\n\\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[060] - OSSP fsl 0.1.12 \\n  by Ralf S.

The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to\\nexisting syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to\\nchange the source code of the program.  \\n\\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[061] - OSSP l2 0.9.0 \\n  by Ralf S.

It is based on the model of arbitrary number of\\nchannels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with\\nfiltering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave\\nnodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through\\nlower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function\\ncontrolled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For\\ngenerating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided\\nwhich can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the\\nchannel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are\\nassigned to each individual channel.  \\n\\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 \\n  by Joo Prado Maia ([URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34\\n\\nCommunications :: Usenet News\\nSoftware Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules\\n\\nAbout: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its\\nmain objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software\\n(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its\\nextensibility enables developers to write their own container for the\\nstorage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is\\nextensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the\\nnews server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to\\nstore the messages. \\n\\nChanges: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial\\ncode for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone\\nMySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for\\nPhorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with\\npassword protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.\\n\\nLicense: BSD License\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[063] - PEANUTS 1.03 \\n  by JP Durman ([URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 06:18\\n\\nSystem :: Systems Administration\\nUtilities\\n\\nAbout: PEANUTS is a console-based Internet user  management system, which\\nis perfect for  system administrators who normally do things  like adding\\nvirtual hosts or new users by hand.

When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads\\nand writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are\\nintercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of\\nuninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,\\nreading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing\\ninappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to\\nmalloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or\\nunaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new\\n[] vs. free/delete/delete []. \\n\\nChanges: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure\\noptimiser bug causing failures like this: \"insane instruction 27: PUTFL\\n%ecx\", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with\\nthe x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red\\nHat \"Limbo\" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do\\nwith free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual\\nadjustments. \\n\\nLicense: GNU General Public License (GPL)\\n\\nURL: [URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[093] - VNC Reflector 1.1.9 \\n  by Const Kaplinsky ([URL]http://freshmeat.net[/URL]\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:49\\n\\nEducation\\nSystem :: Systems Administration\\n\\nAbout: VNC Reflector is a specialized VNC server which acts as a proxy\\nbetween a real VNC server (a host) and a number of VNC clients.
