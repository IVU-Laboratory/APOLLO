Unlike \\neveryone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for \\npermission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a \\nbox of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket \\nwas suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. \\n\\n    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my \\n    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. \\n\\nShe put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They \\ntook everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used \\nthe opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked \\nback up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying \"This can't \\ngo on board.\" \"I don't remember packing that,\" I said. I let her confiscate it. \\n\\nI called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of \\nterrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I \\ncan't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once \\nI'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but \\nif they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the \\nscissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their \\nfists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky \\nmouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, \\nthey use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they \\nuse the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever \\nterrorists. \\n\\n*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was \\nusing to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The \\nnation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  \\n\\n=== Waiting for Wireless === \\n\\nNow I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while \\nbusinessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I \\nused last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, \\nI had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite \\nthe airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, \\nyou know)--I doubt they will accept it. \\n\\n=== Irony === \\n\\nAccording to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his \\nflight. \\n\\nI think of what I'd say if I ran into him. \"Jack!\" I'd exclaim, as if we were \\nold pals. \"Going to the Eldred case?\" Of course he was. \"Going to be a good \\none.\" \"Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?\" I'd ask. \"You said \\nyou were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the \\nInternet. What ever happened to that?\" I imagine him mumbling and looking down \\nat his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. \\n\\nAnother announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing \\nthese airline announcements keep me up to date. \\n\\n=== Automatic Flush Toilets === \\n\\nNow I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In \\nthe first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little \\nshort...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle \\none mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three \\ntimes. \\n\\nThis is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they \\nexpect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied \\nimmediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web \\nsite. \\n\\n=== Arrival === \\n\\nI've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the \\nsidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with \\nLisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now \\nfor the meetings and parties. \\n\\nSorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

This entire article could be \\nrewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. \\n\\nIf it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to \\ndesign a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might \\nlook something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: \\n\\n- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify \\nrequired elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown \\nnumber of parsers around the world. \\n- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, \\nthus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. \\n- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such \\negregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an \\nobsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. \\n- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core \\nnamespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely \\nresistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. \\n- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its \\nadd-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the \\nspec would neither define nor elaborate on. \\n- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements \\nsemantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also \\nfail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the \\nsame thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers \\nand inconsistent behavior across consumers. \\n\\nRSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. \\nFor anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's \\npretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication \\nformat, we have the worst one possible. \\n\\nExcept, of course, for all the others. \\n\\nThe problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of \\nnecessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format \\nhas, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very \\nweaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it \\npossible in the first place. \\n\\n- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened \\nup RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. \\n- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing \\ncontent and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce \\nvalid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social \\nmores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally \\nintroducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable \\ndisplay through unclosed HTML elements. \\n- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't \\nmatter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages \\nwhere handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes \\nand handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out \\nin reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more \\nflexibility. \\n\\nFurthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious \\ncomputational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type \\nDescription? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made \\nit possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this \\nease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts \\nover the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the \\nyear 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: \\n\\n- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which \\nfell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. \\n- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at \\nthe time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years \\nlater, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with \\nparsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF \\nparsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version \\nis generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) \\nMeanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts \\nrecommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to \\nactually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise \\nof better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 \\nfeed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the \\nworld&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets \\ninto a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. \\n- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been \\nhaphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be \\nflourishing. \\n\\nEvolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a \\nthousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to \\ntheir eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. \\n\\n- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. \\nMy RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a \\nTEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know \\nnothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is \\nlittered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. \\nIf everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would \\nbe trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such \\nperfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. \\nThere is no middle ground. \\n- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to \\nearlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, \\nthey are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long \\ndescriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such \\npractices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle \\nthem. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it \\nfaces. \\n- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie \\nOrgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list \\nof RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with \\nany evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS \\n0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it \\n&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is \\nmissing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central \\ngroup can design a better system in the long haul. \\n\\nDesigned formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable \\nformats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect \\nsyndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. \\nInfrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, \\npartially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] [URL]http://www.shirky.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://groups.yahoo.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use  a RAM disk for scratch space.

Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it  read-only:     * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to       reboot, at least.     * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software       have to reboot, at least.

Featured this week is Amy Fowler, who talks about the JavaServer Faces Specification.  Senior Staff Engineer, Java Software, Sun Microsystems    In this interview, Amy talks about the problems JavaServer Faces (JSF) solves and how J2EE developers can leverage it in their Web apps. She looks at UI components used in JSF, the implementation of event handling code, and describes a typical use case involving JSF. She also discusses interoperability with JSF using Struts, Webwork, and the Portlet API.

Get more conference info here Back to Top Enterprise Java Education Strategies Floyd Marinescu to co-teach J2EE Patterns - Sept 16, Dallas  Dear TSS Members, I thought you'd be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J2EE Patterns training course that I will be co-teaching in Dallas during the week of September 16th. The course combines and improves upon the best J2EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns, Sun's Core Patterns, TheServerSide's patterns repository and others.  I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product. This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including TheServerSide.com.  I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J2EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J2EE architecture and design.  If you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:  [URL]http://www.middleware-company.com[/URL] Sincerely,  Floyd Marinescu  Author, EJB Design Patterns  Director of TheServerSide.com J2EE Community  Back to Top New Patterns    iXML Pattern     By Venkatesh Balakumar        In due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of Web services, which will granulate into representing all data in XML. For preparing and implementing Web services, it's necessary to express all data in XML. This pattern does the same. Read more on this pattern.  Widget Pages     By Guilherme Silva        This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users. In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading.  Read more on this pattern. Back to Top New App Server Reviews   JRun 4.0 - Good Stuff      By Jason McKerr        Some general impressions I had of JRun: It's very easy to get it up and running.   Allaire-now-Macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines.  The Java Management Console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.   It's dead easy to plug into just about any IDE (I've done it with JBuilder Enterprise 6, and the Intellij IDEA EAP (Builds 640 -642).  The JSP compiler is smokin! Very, very fast.

Java Server Faces Public Draft and Early Access Available    The public draft of the JavaServer Faces 1.0 Specification has been published, as well as an early access download of the API's and tag library. JSF is a web application framework that reduces the amount of code needed to write a web front end. Developers need only write JSF components and corresponding event handling code, the framework then simplifies the tasks of validation, request parameter parsing, state management, multipe clients support, etc.   Click here to read more.    Meta Group: J2EE Complexity Holding Back Platform Adoption   The Meta Group has released a research report saying that the relative complexity of doing server-side development using J2EE is hurting adoption of the platform. Among other predictions are the continuing dominance of BEA and IBM, more consolidation, and increasing vendor competition in tools and frameworks.     Click here to read more.    IBM nudges back release of WebSphere 5.0   IBM has rescheduled its release of J2EE 1.3 certified Websphere Application Server 5 from September to late November, saying it \"reprioritized\" its schedule in order to release Websphere Studio 5 first - a break from the usual order of releases. Analysts said the delay shouldn't be seen as a big setback.     Click here to read more.
