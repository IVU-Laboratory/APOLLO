If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one. Want to find out more about PGP? You can get the software from: PGPfreeware  GnuPG (GPG)  Bring the following:    *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)    *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key. Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

I installed it before I knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is \"gnome-core\" vs. \"gnome-session\" but I can not remember. Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except updated. There has not been a major change to \"gnomehide\" in a while, I suspect Havoc's work went into Limbo then. -- That's \"angle\" as in geometry. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Certainly  Frequency of messages does _not_ let you draw valid conclusions about the understanding of the issues at hand of the sender. IMHO it's sometimes even inversely proportional. > Marc is an active and prolific contributor to SA (gee, look, his name's  > even in the credit's page on the website!). This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules. That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort. But in his place I would have (hopefully :) reevaluated my arguments in the face of, as I saw it, massive rejection of his idea what constitutes spam. Maybe this list can return to discussing technical topics.
