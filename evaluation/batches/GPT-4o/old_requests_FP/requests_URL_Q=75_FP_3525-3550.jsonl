My name is IDRIS UMAR a merchant in\\nDubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has\\ndefiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a\\nfew months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly\\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even\\nmyself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was\\nalways hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the\\nonly thing I cared for.\\n\\nBut now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than\\njust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when\\nGod gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a\\ndifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have\\nwilled and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and\\nextended family members as well as a few close friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to\\ngive alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last\\ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity\\norganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked\\nmembers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money\\nwhich I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they\\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them\\nanymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of\\neighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a\\nfinance/Security\\nCompany abroad.\\n\\nI will want you to help me collect this\\ndeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.\\n\\n\\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\\n\\nGod be with you.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Sir, \\n  \\nI am sure you will be surprised at this letter that i am sending to you as we have never met before. But let me introduce myself to you. I am Mr. John Taylor, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]  \\n  \\nThe owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. \\n  \\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand\\nas next of kin to a foreigner. \\n  \\nIn appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. \\n  \\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email for further directives. \\n  \\nYours Faithfully, \\nMr. John Taylor.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I currently have within my  reach the sum of fifty-five Million United States Dollars (US$55,000,000.00) , which I intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my late husband and Russian firm on our country's Multi-billion Dollars Lome Steel Plant.\\n \\nThe Russian partners returned my husbands share of US$55 Million after his death and lodged it with my husband 's security Firm in Togo which I am the  Director. Right now the new Civilian Government who is the Son of the first wife has revoked our licenses that allow us to own, have or manage any investment\\nin our Country Togo due to the disparity between me and the first wife of the late  president and also the mother of incumbent President Mr.Faure. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the US$55 Million  from the security company's \\nvault well packaged in trunk boxes and deposited it in a privately erected security safe. I have since declared the  Security Company bankrupt and re-locate the money to another security Firm in nearby country Ghana due to its peaceful atmosphere. No record ever existed concerning the money neither the money traceable by the Government nor any document showing that we received the money from Russian partner. I seek your assistance to move the money out of from Ghana to your country.I am presently taken my asylum in Ghana until the tranfer of the money to your account is over.\\n \\nOn your reply, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in details about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed  to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 30% (Thirty Percent) of the total \\nsum to you for the expected services and assistance.\\n \\nAll arrangement and plan's has been put in place through the help of our family lawyer for the claim and clearing of this fund from the security and finance  Firm as we move the fund directly to your account. Your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I therefore mandate Barrister Short Emile Jnr, who is our family lawyer to deal with you \\non this transaction. You will be required firstly to correspond with our family lawyer, on  Tel:+233-24-4062605 before communicating with me, this is totally for security reasons because people and family relatives has try in the pass to rip me off.

I sent you a letter by post office sometime ago informing you of our \\nplan to transfer the sum of US$20.5million (Twenty\\nmillion, Five hundred thousand US Dollars only) to your account.\\n\\n I have been waiting to hear from you,but up till now, nothing has been \\nheard from you hence this particular message. In any case, I guess that \\nyou may not have received the letter after all due to the shortcomings \\nof our postal system. I want you to know that this fund originated from \\nan Over-invoiced contract sum which was awarded to a foreign firm in \\n1999.\\n\\n I and my three (3)other colleagues in the tender Board purposely \\ninflated the actual cost of the contract to the tune of US$20.5Million. \\nHowever, the original contractor has fully executed the contract, the \\nproject commissioned and the contractor paid his actual contract worth, \\nleaving behind the over-invoiced sum. So, itis based on this that we \\nnow want you / your company to come forward to claim this sum on our \\nbehalf. We are Civil Servants, and we are not allowed to operate \\nforeign account while still in office, so you are therefore to act as \\none who had executed a contract worth the sum of US$20.5million for my \\nDepartment and you now want your payment.This deal is 100% risk free. \\nWe \\nare perfectly in charged and had worked out modalities that would \\nguarantee a hitch free transfer of this fund to your account. \\n\\nWe have also mapped out 30% of the total sum for you for your help and \\nassistance while the remaining is for me and my colleagues. If you are \\ninterested in the proposal, and you are a trustworthy person who would \\nnot sit on this money if it is transferred to your account,kindly \\nindicate by contacting me through my private telephone/fax numbers,or \\nvia my E-mail.You can as well send your bank account details for this \\ntransfer. This deal must be kept absolutely confidential till we \\nsucceed. \\n\\nThank you as we look forward to your anticipated co-operation. NOTE \\n=After a successful transfer, 30% for you, 60% for us, 10% mapped out \\nto settle expenses incurred by both parties in the process oftransfer.\\n\\nWe will also visit you immedaitely we conclude this transaction to \\ncollect and invest our shares of the total sum into any viable business \\nyou may advise us in your country. Contact me urgently through my email \\naddress  philipsss@noolhar.com \\n \\n\\nBest regards \\n\\nPAUL P.

I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.\\n \\nIn my Bank we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8 MILLION in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.\\n\\n[URL]http://seattlepi.nwsource.com[/URL] \\n[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL] \\n \\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n \\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\\n \\nWe agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our Watchword in this transaction.\\n \\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else.

Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. \\n\\nWhats more, there are NO competitors for the Companys method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with\\nMajor Casinos Globally.    \\n \\nMichael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations.  The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons. A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at [URL]http://www.gamingobserver.com[/URL]\\n \\ni2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. \\n\\nFACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corps common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! \\n\\nRECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY\\n\\n     i2corp   \\nOTCBB Symbol                  (ITOO)\\nRecent Price     \t          .05 - .08\\n52-Week Hi-Lo \t          .05 - .48\\nShort Term Target Price:     .60\\n\\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
