[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend,\\n\\nAttention Please.\\n\\n\\nSorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing \\nand Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou \\nBurkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to \\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both \\nof us at the end of the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nDr Idris Ali.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nWindows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bta ! \\n[URL]http://www.ideas.live.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        DEAR BELOVED,  I am Sussan Adams  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I\ufffdm now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer  problems.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.  I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.  Yours in Christ,  Mrs. Sussan Adams  Msg sent via CWNet - [URL]http://www.cwnet.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

NO, there is no catch; just send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.  Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then people send me cash in the mail for information that I just e-mail back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL. Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you must have missed something. \"AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION\"  \"Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, \"No Way!\" read the following. This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money.  The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way to make some extra money at home. And, besides even if you never got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth the money.  They can help you start and advertise ANY business on the internet.  That is, these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet. The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will understand once you experience it.  \"HERE IT IS BELOW\"  *** Print This Now For Future Reference ***  The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at.

It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house except to get the mail.

Get what is rightfully yours. Program yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief system in place.  MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.  You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work.  The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. \"That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!\"  With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business.  Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others.  The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!  In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!  But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\"  Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not 'rip-off\" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me.  Here is the basic version of what you need to do:  Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.  In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done.  By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!  In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security.  If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke  P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur.  Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.  The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor.  As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.\" The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to \"move up\" or \"get rich\". Inflation will see to that.  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with \"NO RISK\"and \"JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.\" You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined.  Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them!  Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.  So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!  \"THINK ABOUT IT.\" Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA  HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$  This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.  Before you say \"No Way!\" please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office.  This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do.  1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't have them).  * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).  *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!  * When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.  * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.  2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps \"a\" through 'g\" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.  a. Look below for the listing of available reports.  b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!  c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.  d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.  e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3  f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.  g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.  Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,. 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter.  Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!  To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.  Here are two primary methods of building your downline:  METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL  Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about level five!  That's $500,000 alone! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 + $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that and more!  REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software.  METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:  1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50  2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500  3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000  4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000  5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000 THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550  Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants.  THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!  AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME ***  * ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of those sheets of paper include:  (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and  (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems).  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:  REPORT #1 \"The Insiders Guide to Advertizing for Free on the Internet\"  ORDER REPORT #1 FROM:  Randy Dillard P.O. Box 8  Osprey, FL 34229  USA  REPORT #2 \"The Insiders Guide to Sending Bulk Email on the Internet\"  ORDER REPORT #2 FROM:   Carla Brown P.O.

Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately.  * Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report.  * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.  * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!  * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!  ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of \"Would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment? Email me with the keywords \"more info\" to find out how. And, when they email you, send them this report in response!  If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!  THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!

THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.  ******* TESTIMONIALS*******  This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR  My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail.\" I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby. \" I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.  The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.  -Charles Morris, Esq.  Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.  -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA  I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA  This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Gooday,\\n\\nWith warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. \\n\\nIt will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. \\n\\nMy name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.\\n\\nWhen the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !\\n En!\\ngland for 9years now. \\n\\nI am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. \\n\\nTo legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. \\n\\nFor valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.\\n\\nPlease, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. \\n\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nDonald Phiri. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\n[URL]http://thinkgeek.com[/URL]\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\n[URL]https://lists.sourceforge.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 43, \"harmless\": 56}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
