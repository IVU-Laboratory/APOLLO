If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!

Sometimes  \\ncalling 100 people **without one single signup!**   Sometimes  \\ntalking to people who have been **bombarded** by bizop pitches  \\nto the point of them _hanging up_ when you call!  (Leads oversold)  \\n  \\nWe're here to help!  \\n  \\nWe'll get you __qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.__  \\n  \\n**Period.**  \\n  \\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.  \\n  \\nWe'll do it __quickly,__ and __professionally__.  \\n  \\n_And we won't ask you for a _single dime_ without **guaranteeing** _results_!  \\n  \\n  \\n_**_Here's How We Generate Our Leads...  \\n  \\n_**- **All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!  \\n  \\n**\\- One source we use for Lead-generation is a **Business Opportunity  \\nSeeker Lead List** of people who have requested info. about making  \\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,  \\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.  \\n  \\n\\- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.  \\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,  \\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in  \\nmaking money from home.  If they are, the system records their  \\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.  \\n  \\n\\- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then  \\n**PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices** and the following  \\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):  \\n  \\n**Name:  \\nEmail:  \\nPhone:  \\nBest time to call:  \\nState:  \\nReason they want to work from home!:  \\nHow much they want to make per month:  \\nHow much time they can commit per week:  \\nHow much money they have available for startup:  \\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:  \\n  \\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no  \\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.  \\n  \\n**\\- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,  \\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.  \\n  \\n\\- This way, **you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time***  \\n(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!  \\n  \\n\\- We **GUARANTEE** that you'll receive _AT LEAST_ a valid _Name_ ,  \\n_Phone Number_ and the _Time-Date Stamp_ corresponding to when  \\nthe Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have  \\nALL of the information asked above.  \\n  \\n  \\n**Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:  \\n  \\n**1\\. They will be **Extremely Qualified** due to the nature of the  \\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).  \\n  \\n2\\. They are **Super-Fresh!**   Delivered in Real-Time only **moments  \\n**after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)  \\n  \\n3\\. They're **Targeted.**   Each Lead we generate originates from a  \\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.  \\n  \\n4\\. They're **Highly Receptive!**   **Receptivity is very, very high**  \\nbecause they **aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching  \\nthem on opportunities!**  Also they'll remember speaking to  \\nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since **we tell them to  \\nexpect your call!  \\n  \\n**5\\. **No \"feast or famine\"** activity.  Leads will be coming in  \\nregularly.  You dictate the flow!  \\n  \\n6\\. **No more cold calls!   **We tell your prospects you'll be calling.  \\n  \\n7\\. You can ***personalize* your approach** with the info. you  \\nget with each Lead!  \\n  \\n8\\. **Save Time.   **Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.  \\n  \\n9\\. **Lower \"burnout\" factor.**  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier  \\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.  \\n  \\n10\\. You can **sort your Leads** based on their responses and call the  \\nhottest ones first.  \\n  \\n11\\. You can **get new reps started quicker** using these Leads due  \\nto **higher closing ratios**.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger  \\nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of  \\n\"quick successes\".  \\n  \\n12\\. The **Leads will be uniform** \\- almost all leads will have the info.  \\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)  \\n  \\n13\\. They're **double-qualified** because to generate the Lead,  \\na list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.  \\n  \\n14\\. Excellent **control of the flow of Leads** coming through.  \\n  \\nIf you've been trying to run things too long without a _steady flow_ of high  \\nquality leads, call us __NOW__ to get things in motion.  Just let us know  \\nwhat program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized  \\nlead-generation campaign for you.  \\n  \\nSince your need to get business moving has probably never been  \\nmore critical than it is today, why not call us **_NOW!  \\n  \\n_**These are **__fresh, highly qualified leads__** because these people aren't  \\njust responding to some \"Generic Business Opportunity\" ad, they're  \\ncontacted **over the phone specifically** for **_YOUR_** company!  And we  \\nforward you the leads within **_minutes_** of the lead being generated - not  \\ndays, weeks, or months!  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nStart Generating As Many **SIGN-UPS** as You Can Handle!  \\nExplode Your Downline and Income!  \\n  \\n**Call For Details and Discount Pricing!  \\nToll Free _1-866-853-8319_ ext.1  \\n  \\n**Or email us here for full details  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nTo opt out _Click Here  \\n  \\n  \\n_ \\--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is\\nsponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications\\nplatform!
