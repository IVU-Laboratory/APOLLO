Yeah, well, I'm about to chuck the whole darned thing right now: the first upgrade to Gnome2 wiped out the possibility of changing preferences...exactly what got me outta Ximian before.

The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax \\ncredit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees \\ncarry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 \\nbillion in goods and services, the audit found.\\n\\nIn one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and \\ngovernment-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, \\nthen spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to \\nsupply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their \\ntravel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.\\n\\n\"Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a \\nstrip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling \\nsuit?\" asked Dasbach. \"Americans who support a bigger defense budget, \\ntake note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, \\nreckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the \\nworthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even \\nimagine.\"\\n\\nOther spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury \\ncruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and \\narmchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.\\n \\nSome military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit \\nnoted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can \\nbe \"a useful tool for building good relations with a host country\" \\nsuch as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. \\n\\nNot surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found \"little evidence of \\ndocumented disciplinary action\" against those who misused the cards, \\nso taxpayers may end up paying the tab.\\n  \\n\"It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat \\nDefense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse \\ntaxpayers for every penny of improper spending,\" he said.\\n \\n\"Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard \\nagainst such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to \\nforce the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, \\ninstead of offending the taxpayer.\"\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.6.2\\n\\niQCVAwUBPUA6FdCSe1KnQG7RAQGAKwP/Zpfw0Uq3BPLnXXmnlWQ2aFFb1FSaj+nJ\\nQOMt9q4TBhiYJhIdgdd+uGxoubiPfvyIweSR1PjOdoFe8dYf2h/V4gNS9hSmkSgC\\n76RZVuitNf2DbEsaY8TtcUDLDC51m/jgxiGcgPkcyJ+0Wn11RRbktkVEefSNTaBz\\nM8ibVFiDPyI=\\n=9fYc\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Libertarian Party                                [URL]http://www.lp.org[/URL]\\n2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100                    voice: 202-333-0008\\nWashington DC 20037                                   fax: 202-333-0072\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFor subscription changes, please use the WWW form at: \\n[URL]http://www.lp.org[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

The short answer is \\nno, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.\\n\\nThe longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good \\njob, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.\\n\\nYou may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to \\nread you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.\\nI've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning \\ncurve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),\\nI'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which \\nrequire a response.\\n\\nAnother option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely \\naccessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, \\nthough it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it \\nis a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite \\ncustomizable.\\n\\nThe real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server \\nthat understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client \\ncould connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) \\nto cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh \\ncommands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to \\na remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.\\n\\n-- \\n\\nSeeya,\\nPaul\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-users mailing list\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\n[URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

I'm running with autosort right now.  If I don't see any problems, I' run with  autopack for a while. I did find some stuff that was being called too many times when auto-sort was enabled, but otherwise it seems to be working. My computer is a lot faster than the last time I tried autosort (back in the  mid-90s); this is actually acceptable. Once I've confirmed that nothing actually breaks, I think I'll look into a few  more places that autosort needs to be called, because right now it only sorts  when you change to a folder, but if a new message arrives in the folder you're  looking at, it doesn't get sorted.

Assuming a 2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12 cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the weight of 200 kg here on Earth. So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about four orders of magnitude too small. If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1 cm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s, or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not possible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass, as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything approaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around 2.2 cm/s instead. The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU). (And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.) The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed acceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if we were to start accelerating it now. All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its gravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile in ways I don't understand. They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference is probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path. What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to provide the needed acceleration? Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other direction, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over twenty-five years to adjust its orbit. *** About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better solutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK mail to be detained for scanning.

This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an essay about why some event happened.

These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.

Delay is generally defined as the time it takes from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually has many components.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume. Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear behind the curtain, and all that. However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and Henry \"Dr. Doom\" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might* come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing, key-punching \"administration\" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago, chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what, 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting... A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a pressurized cabin to breathe in. So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for a house, tulips are still nice things to have around. Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you will. So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while there's blood in the streets. As to whether the accounting is \"rigged\", remember what Robert Heinlein said: \"Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you don't play.\" Cheers, RAH The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look behind the curtain, right? :-). - --- begin forwarded text From: Somebody Else To: \"R.

Information ----------- you may remember me from sweaty nights of passion, or perhaps from yesterday when i announced the release of a piece of software i wrote (many years ago too btw). in general i received no feedback from this, cept from one guy having problems downloading it (howd that go btw?) and then this: From: \"Michael\" To: \"'Demi Sex God from Hell'\" Subject: RE: ass the attack spoofing shell Annoying. Pointless. well! how very very rude. that really was uncalled for. (propz to dme yo!). gay, bi or curious, i went to find out more about mystical michael, who is obviously very important as he is the only one who felt the need to tell me they didnt like me. it turns out, hes a bit of programmer, with some code available on his website ([URL]www.tenebrous.com[/URL] I got codeblue, (btw mystical mike your auto-download script for you counter gives me a 500 error), a log checking utility mystical mike wrote and released under the GNU GPL to make the world a better place. If this tool is run as root (say nightly from roots crontab) there is a potential remote root. in any case, regardless of user, there is always a remote. if codeblue is locally suid, theres many overflows all throughout it, easy peasy like the girls in st patricks!!!. Note st patricks is a great place in sydney, playground of the rich and famous. visit it if you ever visit sydney, tell them i sent you. so lets have a walk through the code, and get a feel for mystical mike, the man behind the mystic.
