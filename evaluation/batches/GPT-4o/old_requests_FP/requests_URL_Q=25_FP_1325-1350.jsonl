I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type \"make\" after I get the output from the ./configure. \\n\\nHowever, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing \\n* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config\\n* make oldconfig\\n* make dep\\nThe 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?\\n\\nAlso, when I was in the pctel directory and typed \"make\", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after \"make\". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory\\n/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory\\n\\nThe odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?\\n\\nIt's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated.

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert into apt and let loose... :) Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC.

There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good  starting point to search is [URL]http://www.freshmeat.net[/URL] However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as  they are on Windows platform for two main reasons: 1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are  respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters. 2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this  software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and  open source.

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function  check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules  files still lurking around?

Just mirror the needed directories (e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one installation.
