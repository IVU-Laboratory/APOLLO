He then ordered his party members and the police\\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn't even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I've used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt's time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.

I had to bring before you this proposal because I sincerely hope you will be reliable to assist me. \\n\\n\\n \\nHowever, my name is above stated and I am the personal Attorney to Mr. Farooq Ahmed, a national (Citizen) of Malaysia who was working with Shell Petroleum Development Company here in South Africa. Here in after shall be referred to as my Client. \\n\\n Meanwhile, on the 21-08-2005, my client and his family were involved in a car accident along Pretoria Expressway while on their way to picnic, and all the occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to his Embassy here to locate any of my clients Extended Relatives, but all my effort to locate his relatives was abortive and unsuccessful. So after these unsuccessful attempts, I finally got your contact while I was on a random search. \\n\\n I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating huge amount of money that belongs to my death Client; the amount involved is US$14.7Million (Fourteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars). I sincerely need your urgent assistance before it will be confisicated or declared unserviceable by the South African Reserve Bank, where this huge amount was deposited. The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of Kin to the deceased or have the fund confisicated  by the end of this year. For the fact that I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since you come from the same country with my client, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. \\n\\n Therefore, on my receipt to your positive response, we shall discuss on the modus operandi of the transaction/transfer. Note that I have all the necessary information and legal strength required to back up for this claim. All I need from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of the law. \\n\\n Conclusively, your contacts are very essential to facilitate communication, so endeavour to enclose your Telephone, Mobile and fax numbers. Further discussion/elaboration will commence as soon as I hear or read from you, but do not forget the absolute confidentiality and mutual trust required in this transaction. Kindly contact me on the above-specified channels of contact. \\n\\n\\nThanks and God Bless You. \\n\\n Yours Truly, \\n\\n Barrister, Fredrick Thambo \\n\\n(Attorney-At-Law & Public Notary) \\n_________________________________________________________________\\nNews, entertainment and everything you care about at Live.com.

Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.  Please note that I can not open any Bank account with  my name because, My late husband's first  son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, He claimed that when  our husband was alive, that I was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)  mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that I was able to get things from him more  than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.  Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  Thanking you in advance. Yours faithfully,  Deborah Kabila (Mrs.)  N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for  more explanations. ------------------------------------------------------------ [URL]http://Game.37.com[/URL]  <--- Free Games [URL]http://newJoke.com[/URL]   <---  J O K E S  ! ! ! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Express yourself with a super cool email address from BigMailBox.com.

And for your perusal you can view this web \\nsite: [URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]  This credit was \\nheld with our banks here in South Africa and the Director of \\nAccount/Operations approached us since he cannot transfer this fund alone \\nwithout going through us (i.e. The International Remittance Department).\\n\\nWith our position and experience, we have worked out the modalities in such \\na way that the transaction will take seven bank working days to accomplish. \\nOn the receipt of your approvals, I will be in a very good position to give \\nyou details on the agreed sharing ratio.\\n\\nThis may come as a surprise to you but as we progress, I will be able to \\nexplain to you how I got your contact. Meanwhile, we are 100% positive that \\nyou can handle this therefore, contact me on +27-837466810 or E-mail: \\ngillmbabane@yahoo.com as soon as you receive this urgent message.\\n\\nI am anticipating your urgent response while thanking you in advance for \\nyour understanding and co-operation.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMr. Gill Mbabane\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDiscover the magic of RSS feeds at MSN South Africa!
