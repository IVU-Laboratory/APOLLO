( [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\ntm)\\n \\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Holland to deposit the\\nsum of US 8.4 million {Eight million four hundred thousand United States\\ndollars}, in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming\\ndanger in Zimbabwe.\\n \\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe\\nintroduce a new land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and\\nsome few black farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by\\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of\\npeople were killed because of this land reform Act for which my father was\\none of the victims.\\n \\nIt is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear\\nof our lives and are currently staying in Holland where we are seeking\\npolitical asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's money to a\\nmore reliable foreign account. Since the law of Holland prohibits a refugee\\n{asylum seeker} to open any bank account or to be involve in any financial\\ntransaction. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the\\nresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner/account where this money\\ncould be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on\\ntaking everything we have acquired.\\n \\nSir / Madam, If you are willing to undertake this with me I am willing to\\ngive you 25% of the fund for your assistance and I have also mapped out 5%\\nto cover any expenses incurred from the transaction. Also be aware the\\nbalance amount will be set aside for the investment through you and the\\nprofit from the investment will be share 50% each for you and my family\\nafter expenses.\\nPlease contact me on my e-mail address or my phone number below.\\n \\nYours sincerely,\\nMr. Clive Osborne\\n+31626662624.\\nEmail:mrcliveosborn@netscape.net\\nreply to mrcliveosborn@netscape.net\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I agree that 45% of this money will be for you \\nas  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for \\nexpenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.\\n\\nThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \\npercentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  \\nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  \\nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  \\nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective\\ncommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.\\n\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of \\nthe application.

I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. \\nThe latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:[URL]http://www.newswatchngr.com[/URL]] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; [URL]http://www.thisdayonline.com[/URL], click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.\\nOn this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.\\nAnd thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. \\nMy problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.\\nI shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.\\nIn acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.\\nThanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation.

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some\\ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future\\nmay be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to\\nremain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. \"Every major\\nindustry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar\\ntransformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the\\nmid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,\" says Robert\\nSaunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm.\\nChristopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says \"We are seeing all the people\\nthat are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving\\ncarriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few\\nmillions.\" _Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the\\nlink at the end of this newsletter._\\n\\nAs we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT)\\nhas only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As\\nInDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this\\ncompany will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector.\\nThis could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our\\nHighest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential**\\n\\nWe believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition.\\nA similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),\\nshare price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over\\n$0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously\\nhad a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267\\nmillion.\\n\\nIGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for\\npotential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a\\nfew months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an\\nincrease of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time\\nis right for investors to get in on the ground floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n**The _InDigNet_ Strategy**\\n\\nInDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet\\nis a prestigious \"Diamond\" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for\\nCisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and\\nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to\\noffer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building\\na communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer\\nbases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively\\npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). _The Company recently completed its\\nacquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect_. InDigiNet will then\\nexpand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance\\nprofitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data\\nservices and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and\\nthis spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten\\nyears. _Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter_.\\n\\nThe IGTT web site: [URL]www.indiginet.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n**The __ IT Market**\\n\\nBased on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag\\nsignificantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including\\nInternet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT\\nspending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7\\npercent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market\\nresearcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights,\\ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time.\\nIn IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in\\nthe US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436\\nbillion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect\\ngrowth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will\\nexperience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market\\nwill return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China,\\nIndia, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. _Source:IDC_\\n\\n\\n\\n**Particulars**\\n\\nThe Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth\\nrecommendation list for the following reasons:\\n\\n1\\. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller,\\nsingle-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the\\nacquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution\\nchannel for all types of communication services - local, long distance,\\nwireless, and data.\\n\\n  \\n2\\. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range\\ncommunities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the\\nvalue of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing\\ncampus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic\\nCommittee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University.\\n\\n  \\n3\\. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to\\nacquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and\\nsmaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the\\ntargeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to\\npurchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Investment Consideration**\\n\\nInDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1\\n2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for\\ntheir first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and\\nmore large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to\\nsmall to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.
