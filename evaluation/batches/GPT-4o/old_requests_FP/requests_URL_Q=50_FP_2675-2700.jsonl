In an account that belongs to one of \\nour foreign customer who died along with his wife and two children in July \\n2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have \\nbeen expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we \\ncannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation \\nto the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we \\nlearnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him \\nin the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\n                          You can also confirm this in the website as \\nfollow:\\n\\n                      [URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I in my department now decided to \\nmake this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of \\nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates \\nthat if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will be \\ntransferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.\\nThe request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late \\ncustomer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a \\nforeigner. We agree that 27% of this money will be for you as foreigner \\npartner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,3% will be set \\naside for expenses incurred during the business and 70% would be for me and \\nmy colleague, after which we shall  visit your country for disbursement \\naccording to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \\ntransfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank, \\nand send your account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy \\nand effective communication and location where  the money will be remitted.\\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \\nthe application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance \\nmaneger,for easy execution of the transaction.\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% \\nhitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the \\ntransfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this \\nletter.\\n\\nTrusting to receive your urgent reply through my alternative Email \\n:mrs_ajaha66@yahoo.fr\\nBest regards.\\n\\nMRS AJAHA AHMED\\nBILL AND EXCHANGE (ASSIST.)MANAGER,\\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNEXE,\\nOUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTestez Windows Live Mail Beta !

But \\nall the same, I believe we do not \\nneed to be of blood relatives before we can establish cordial/business \\nrelationship. Having said this,I \\nthink it is very important at this juncture to introduce myself to you.\\nI am Mr.Wiilams Terry\\n, Head: Enterprise Wide Risk and member of the \\nexecutive and risk committees of \\nCommecial Bant of Senegal.I got your information while browsing \\nthrough internet in search of a \\nreliable person who will assist me.This is an urgent and very \\nconfidential business proposition. \\nOn June 7, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the  \\nSenegal Institute of Mining and \\nMetallurgy, Mr.Kurt Kahle made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for \\ntwelve calendar months, valued at \\nUS$10,500, 000.00,(Ten Million, five hundred thousand Dollars). \\nUpon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \\nbut got no reply. After a month, we \\nsent a reminder and finally we discovered from his Private Business \\nSchool. employers, that On the 31st \\nof July 2000, our client, with his 37-year-old wife and his son \\nMichael, aged eight died in the Air France \\nconcord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world \\ncruise, with other passengers abroad \\nas you can confirm it yourself via the website below:\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL] \\nOn further investigation,I found out that he died without making a \\n\"WILL\",and all attempts to trace his \\nnext of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and \\ndiscovered that Mr.Mr.Kurt Kahle did \\nnot declare any next of kin or relations in all his official \\ndocuments,including his Bank Deposit paperwork \\nin my Bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my \\nbank for safekeeping. No one \\nwill ever come forward to claim it.According to Senegal Law, at \\nthe expiration of 5 (five) years, the \\nmoney will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies \\nto claim the fund. \\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to \\nstand as the next of kin to Mr. Kurt Kahle \\nso that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands \\nof some corrupt Government officials.I \\nam writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign \\naccount. I want to present you \\nas the owner of the funds so you will be able to claim them with the \\nhelp of my attorney.I will like you to \\nprovide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney \\nwill prepare the necessary \\ndocuments which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. \\nThe money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me \\nand 40% for you. The paperwork \\nfor this transaction will be done by the Attorney If you are \\ninterested, please reply immediately via my \\nemail address and upon your response,I shall then provide you with more \\ndetails that will help you \\nunderstand the transaction.\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this \\ntransaction would be most profitable \\nfor both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my \\nshare in real estate within your country. \\nDue to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our \\ncommunication can only be via email and fax \\nmostly.\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via email. willam77terry@yahoo.co.uk\\nThanks and my regards.\\nMr.Wiiilams Terry.\\nPLEASE REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL:\\nNOTE: If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly delete/destroy \\nthis email in view of the \\nconfidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of \\npersonalities involves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this is a criterion I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with my people for security and safety reasons.\\n \\nI am a stepson and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).\\n \\nYou may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this led to an insurgence of several factions and has left no hope for peace anytime nearby.  To understand more on the situation click on this link [URL]http://www.state.gov[/URL] \\n \\n I decided to flee my country, as I desired a peaceful life, and I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. \\n \\nTo the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad\u0092s Private Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives and properties.\\nThis money has been moved in cash in a trunk to my present location in Europe through diplomatic means. I plan to invest this money in diversified projects, and relocate to a private location. As you can understand, the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order have my plans achieved in the shortest possible time. When the trunk is claimed, we shall firstly have the money deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to me at the appropriate time for the investments and my relocation. \\nAlso, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing all this information to you, hence it is only me (apparently you now) that have knowledge of this. The importance of prosecuting this within the next few days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly appreciated.\\nIf you accept to assist me, for your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \\nOn hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and explain details of your role in this.

THE\\nPROPOSAL, After the swearing in ceremony making me the\\nDeputy Minister of Safety and Security, my husband Mr.\\n Ndelebe  Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to\\nTrinidad and Tobago in 1996.\\n\\nAfter his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a\\ndollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a\\nsecurity and finance institution in South Africa  of which\\nI will divulge information to you when I get your full\\nconsent and support to go for a change of beneficiary and\\nsubsequent transfer of the funds into you a comfortable and\\nconducive account of your choice.\\n\\n This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced\\ncontract  which he executed with the Government of South\\nAfrica. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but\\nI never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid\\nthat the government of South Africa might start to\\ninvestigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they\\ndiscover this money in his bank account, they will\\nconfiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and\\nthis will definitely affect my political career in\\ngovernment. I want your assistance in opening an account\\nwith bankers through my banker so that this fund could be\\nwired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon\\nas the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move\\nit immediately into another personal bank account in your\\ncountry.\\n\\n I will see to it that the account is not traced from South\\nAfrica. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your\\naccount, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come\\nto your country to discuss on business investments. For\\nyour assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum\\nwhich amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred\\nThousand United States Dollars Only)And 5% will be for Any\\nexpenses that both of us may Incure in this transaction.\\nAnd another 5%will go for Motherless babes home.\\nHowever, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into\\nagreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If\\nyou agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send\\nme an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South\\nAfrican Government, I prefer you send me email than call.\\nAll correspondence must be by email to my private email\\naddress, {susanshabangu00@netscape.net} If you want to\\nspeak with my Banker or my elder son,that is fine and okay\\nby me.you can contact my son on his dilect line\\n{+27-73-323-0163}his name is {MR Morris shabangu}and You\\nwill have to send down you private telephone /fax number so\\nthat i can forward it to him to reach you from time to time\\nthis is for security reasons. Please I do not need to\\nremind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality of this\\ntransaction.If you do not feel comfortable with this\\ntransaction, do not hesitate to discontinue. \\n\\n \\nThanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to\\nyour family. \\n\\n \\nYours faithfully, \\n  \\n\\nMRS.

I decided to contact \\nyou for a beneficial and risk-free business transaction.\\n\\nDuring our auditing and investigations in this bank,my department came \\n\\nacross the sum of (US$35,000,000.00) THIRTY-FIVE-MILLION UNITED STATES \\nDOLLARS ONLY, belonging to an international business man who \\ndied along with his family on the 31st October 1999 in a plane crash, \\nin an Egyptian airline ( Egypt- Air) 990 - with other passengers on board. \\nYou can confirm this from the website below which was published by \\nCNN.WEBSITE.[URL]http://www.cnn.com[/URL]\\nOR [URL]www.theatlantic.com[/URL] .\\n\\nBefore our discovery of this development, there was no trace of claim \\nfrom\\nany person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank. \\nAlthough\\nI keep this information secret whitin my jurisdiction to enable us put \\nclaims\\nand transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom\\nwe shall indirectly present to the bank as the bonafide next-of-kin to \\nthe deceased for a profitable and successful transaction - Because \\nafter five\\nyears the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account \\nas unclaimed\\nbills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it is \\non this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his \\nname shall be \\nused as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to\\nshare this money amongst them at the end of the year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, all the arrangments/documents to put claims as the bonafide \\nnext-of-kin to the deceased,to get the required approval and transfer \\nof\\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place.The directives \\nand\\nthe needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate \\nyour\\ninterest and willingness to cooperate fully.Infact, we could have done\\nthis alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to \\noperate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise \\nan eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are \\nstaffs of the bank.These are the actual reasons why it requires a \\nsecond-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support\\nas the bonafide next-of-kin.And also present a foreign bank account\\n(Old or New account)where the money will be transfered into.\\n\\nOn conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be set aside for \\ncontingency,while 70% will be for me and my partners here.\\nPlease you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in \\nservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with \\nyou.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until \\nyou confirm the money in your account,We then come down to your country\\nfor subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages \\nindicated above, and for investment purpose like in any country you \\nmay as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money.\\nAll other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive \\nan email response from you or a telephone call.\\n\\nPls.

We rank the 10 companies that are benefiting most from the deployment of new TV technology.  This week's highlights: Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV merger?; why did Cox scale back its Video on Demand plans?; why did Liberty Media buy a cable company in the Netherlands?; and  who at NBC is smoking crack? Find out in this all-new edition of... The Interactive TV Power Rankings! =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= TiVo: Now or Never? =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= [URL]http://rs6.net[/URL] Ready for this? The next five months could determine whether  TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service, ultimately survives as a business. TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less  than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock dipped below three this week. And network execs are openly questioning whether the digital recorder, which permits skipping commercials with a few  clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising models. There even have been hints that the  networks could support a move by the cable  industry to offer a PVR that does not permit commercial skipping. And that PVR would not  be a TiVo.  To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful  at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo  reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have recommended the service to a friend. And when people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just  like the way people say \"Coke\" when they talk about soft drinks. ) But Wall Street, the media and the industry  are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start putting some big numbers on the board --  and it needs to do it this holiday season. If  it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo  until now will run for the hills. That will push the company's stock price down even further. And if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices: Sell the company under duress or wait until its  funding dries up.  Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch  an intensive marketing blitz over the next  five months, right through the holiday season. The blitz will include a sharp increase in  retail distribution, TV advertising and PR  efforts. The company needs to show Wall  Street -- and the industry -- that it will be  the brand leader in the PVR category. And it needs to show that it can generate mass consumer demand.  How does TiVo demonstrate that? Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end will have people questioning whether TiVo has the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching TiVo closely, might decide that adding the  service is not such a great selling point  after all. And Echostar, which currently does not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide to stay with its unbranded PVR service after  its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C.  (TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV, but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if  the merger is approved.)  So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided in the next several months.  Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve a partial success. The company will boost its  subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I  also predict it will decide to sell the company to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the  necessary funding and industry connections for long-term growth and survival.
