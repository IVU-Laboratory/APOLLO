But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to \"vote\" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no \"no\" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a \"yes\" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 \"yes\" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.\\n\\nThe system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.\\n\\nAs far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.\\n\\nSo ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?\\n\\nIsaac\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Patrick\\nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 2:13 PM\\nTo: Oates, Isaac\\nCc: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net\\nSubject: Re: [Razor-users] many vs one\\n\\nOn Wed, 14 Aug 2002, Oates, Isaac wrote:\\n\\n> I'm new to razor but have studied trust systems before.

One bloke's opinion: Date: Sat, 01 Jun 2002 00:18:29 -0700 From: \"J.T.S. Moore\"  Reply-To: jtsmoore@pacificnet.net To: Marc MERLIN ,    Daniel Isacc Walker  CC: svlug@svlug.org, Rick Moen , sluglug@sluglug.ucsc.edu,    Peter Belew , \"Eric A. Perlman\" ,    i3e-off@cse.ucsc.edu, slug-web@sluglug.ucsc.edu Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening To all, I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake. Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members. I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.   One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter to Hobbyists.   The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement, but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a vegetarian.   I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.   I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine.  However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy. One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of preserving the educational/institutional market. Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish.  It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS. I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested persons to legally view it. I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone. Sincerely, J.T.S.

Would be nice to have a unified tool for DVD/CD burning - already I do my CD burning from dvdrecord since it is more recent.

It doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of \"files for xmame\" ;-) Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set here in Spain...).

Maybe you'll need to \"override\" other paths when doing the \"make\". Second, the \"%makeinstall\" macro automatically overrides many common values like \"prefix=\" or \"datadir=\", so it's completely redundant with the \"PREFIX=\" you're passing to it. Take a look at the \"Makefile\" you have at that point to see how the \"install\" target is, and what it uses. Last, as Chris suggested, you can take a look at an existing package, like the one in Rawhide ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  [URL]http://lists.freshrpms.net[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave  the commission its latest layoff numbers. IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\") Only after \"months of surreptitious layoff notices\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected.  An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \"rebalancing\" and more employees than expected  taking voluntary layoffs.  Sorry, we're still back on \"rebalancing.\" Did IBM \"rightsize\" last quarter, too? IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees  from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh.  OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \"stealth layoffs,\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.

[URL]http://release1.edventure.com[/URL] ----------------------------------------------------------------- SYNERGY AND BETRAYAL AT VIVENDI ----------------------------------------------------------------- Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle  up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin.  It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first  half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost.  Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the \"Curious George\" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper.  Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean.

We are doing this because the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the press release here: [URL]http://www.vasoftware.com[/URL] How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much difference other then the site will continue to grow and the SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months. If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site, please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always appreciate the feedback. Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the Open Source Community. Pat- Patrick McGovern Director, SourceForge.net 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source community can always obtain the software released by hosted projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world, as to provide better download times regardless of which network provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location. Three new download servers have recently been added to our network, further strengthening our file serving capabilities.

I didn't subscribe to this list!!! You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful phrases here)\".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net there was a check box that said \"Receive Site-wide updates, low volume\".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form, hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6 weeks, so it truly is low volume.

Well, this mostly worked, despite Colm saying that \"you want the \"failed-disk\" *instead* of the second \"raid-disk\", not in addition to it\".  I suppose that means instead of: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         raid-disk       1 >  >         failed-disk     1  I should have had: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         failed-disk     1  It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive after the raid-disk one :)  Anyway.

Any ideas why ?  My suspicion is that I've a lack of knowledge about how initrd works, so I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only, fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it.  Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it to load the initrd ?

Analysts\\nboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from\\nthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to what\\nthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what content\\ncontrol itself really means.\\n\\nThe most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not\\nwhether they may interfere with the power of the universal\\nlogic device, or whether they are effectual from the\\nstandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these\\nare all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental\\nproblem they present is in the political premises that they\\nhope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\"\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the\\nconcepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\\nTreaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May\\n20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The\\nWPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to\\ncontrol public uses of their works.\\n\\n*That's* the real game plan.\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the\\nmasses.  They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content\\ncontrol under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the\\npublic to overlook the clear public interest issues raised\\nby the specter of content control, and to confuse these\\nissues with private interest issues such as privacy and\\nsecurity.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on\\nthe bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's\\nreally on the line.\\n\\nIn America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral\\nrights\" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution\\naccords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive\\nrights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting\\nthe progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the\\npurpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though\\nthat result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights\\nstatutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court\\nexplicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good\\nreason.  In America, we implicitly understand the\\ndistinction between expression, the aspect of works to which\\ncopyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make\\nup a work, to which it does *not* apply.\\n\\nThe reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must\\nbe stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:\\ninformation is free.

It can     be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called from     a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a genetic-algorithm     evolved scoring system to identify messages which look spammy, then     adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the user's mail     reading software.
