Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of = Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of C= hina. _The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, = and present information that is highly in demand by the market._ = Apart from the core print and electr= onic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, su= ch as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and tr= aining in the field of wealth management and personal finance.=   These areas are closely linked to the cor= e competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands th= at they have built to further drive the growth potential. CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Repub= lic of China. **In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right = from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direc= t management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Develo= pment Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.** = **HIGHLIGHTS:** = May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Excl= usive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish= , Internationally. February 20= 02, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market r= esearch provider. March 2002, = CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique f= inancial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of Ch= ina. May 7, 2002, CXIN a= nnounces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket c= ompany and the _leading provider of emerging market securities_. May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had= hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President= , Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China M= orning Post and Asia Magazine. June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling = subscriptions. June 24, 2002, = CXIN announces the acquisition of  **Smart Investor Magazine** and= related business. _This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consol= idated revenues.  _ Jul= y 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, _one = of the worlds largest aggregators._  **INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:** According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, w= hich analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 yea= rs to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this i= ndustry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchan= dise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well position= ed to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing C= hinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted= by the Chinese government provide the company with an \"unfair advant= age\" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent licen= se agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the= world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will e= nable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Millio= n within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancin= g, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue a= nd profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares= do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sec= tor CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and abov= e this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.
