Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference. Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids  to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those  messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have changed. Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of  one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.   In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence. If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has  been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to  sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a  one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages  removed.

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and  Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it  only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the  \"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename\" output in the debug log to see when sequences  are actually reread from disk. My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to  investigate that. >   | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less  >   | than 48 hours. >  > Have a good vacation. Thanks.

That was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting, for example, or you are selecting a message to display.  > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current  > folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the  > directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so... glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder * will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents. But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun. Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is already pretty tricky  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time, but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about the folder. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network [URL]www.panasas.com[/URL] welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}

Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British\\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \\n \\n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \\n \\n During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\\n the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are\\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. \\n \\n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\\n Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in\\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont\\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. \\n \\n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \\n \\n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \\n \\n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \\n \\n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me\\nfriend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.\\n\\nSome expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of\\nhaving to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to\\nLinux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have\\nto go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).\\n\\nThanks a million.\\nCarlos\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\n[URL]http://www.linux.ie[/URL] for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 47, \"undetected\": 52, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 50}"}]}}
