Restricting the entries to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't it? My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check     if {$msgid != {}} { \t# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead \tif {$msgid < 0}  return     } else {     ... at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case. Perhaps the thing to do is for MsgChange to validate a msgid as a number before continuing.

Unlike competing solutions that \\n> process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes \\n> the data in \\n> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater \\n> performance, \\n> according to company officials.\\n> \\n> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the \\n> first in a \\n> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based \\n> startup. The \\n> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\n> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\n> data.\\n> \\n> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\n> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\n> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data \\n> between two \\n> businesses.\\n> \\n> \"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n> \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n> \\n> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \\n> file size up \\n> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\n> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\n> alternative.\\n> \\n> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\n> importance in the world of XML.\\n> \\n> \"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\n> said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\n> Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n> \\n> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\n> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n> \\n> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\n> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach \\n> the company \\n> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \\n> regards to speed \\n> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\n> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n> \\n> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\n> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \\n> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\n> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \\n> he believes \\n> will be mostly false.\\n> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\n> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes \\n> of a packet, \\n> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \\n> 1,400 bytes \\n> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n> \\n> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \\n> collection of \\n> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \\n> markup language \\n> as they pass through the device.\\n> \\n> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\n> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \\n> will identify \\n> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n> \\n> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an \\n> application \\n> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators \\n> more granular \\n> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\n> controls the device.\\n> \\n> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging \\n> market. Startup \\n> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega \\n> XPE switch in \\n> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, \\n> launched with a \\n> focus on content processing and acceleration.\\n> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at \\n> $54,995. The \\n> company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\n> field trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n> \\n> ==============================================================\\n> ===========\\n> \\n> DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs \\n> since it was \\n> founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\n> foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\n> would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry \\n> interest in XML \\n> grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\n> designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique \\n> requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was \\n> a software \\n> interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML \\n> processing \\n> is still licensed by many companies for use in their own \\n> products today.\\n> \\n> Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\n> developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team \\n> raised the bar \\n> and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built \\n> hardware. In \\n> 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the \\n> industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n> \\n> Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML \\n> network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\n> Services. While other companies are just now marketing first \\n> versions of \\n> products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \\n> providing an immediate return on technology investments to \\n> industry-leading customers and partners.\\n> \\n> DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \\n> brings decades of experience in the networking and computing \\n> industries, \\n> drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\n> Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\\n> \\n> ==============================================================\\n> ===========\\n> \\n> DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\\n> \\n> Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital \\n> Back Pioneer \\n> in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\\n> \\n> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \\n> leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \\n> that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \\n> this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital \\n> and Seed \\n> Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, \\n> of Mobius, \\n> and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of \\n> Directors.\\n> \\n> DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, \\n> marketing and \\n> sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware \\n> networking. \\n> Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML \\n> networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and \\n> transactions \\n> at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web \\n> services \\n> and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on \\n> its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.\\n> \\n> \"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \\n> intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \\n> prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \\n> DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed \\n> processing of \\n> XML that is required to support next generation enterprise \\n> applications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \\n> Technology.\\n> \\n> \"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats \\n> critical to Web \\n> services projects without sacrificing an ounce of \\n> performance.\" A single \\n> DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \\n> serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \\n> processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \\n> addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \\n> protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \\n> e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load \\n> balancing \\n> between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\\n> \\n> \"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \\n> laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology \\n> addresses \\n> a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \\n> Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \\n> DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \\n> free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \\n> performance and security pitfalls.\"\\n> \\n> \"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing \\n> the rapidly \\n> growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \\n> security,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \\n> \"DataPower is on \\n> their third generation of technology.

Best, \\nRohit\\n\\n===========================================================\\n\\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\\nByScott Tyler Shafer\\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\\n\\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\\n\\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\\n\\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\\n\\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\\n\\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\\n\\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\\n\\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\\n\\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\\n\\nco-processor.

Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people can't use the code in normal ways. But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the problem, I have just been playing).   That will do it (every time). That is: 0 ^h - Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every character you type, until a message is selected with the mouse. This is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a look at it later. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com [URL]https://listman.redhat.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ITA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 71, \"undetected\": 28, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 75}"}]}}

Best, \\nRohit\\n\\n===========================================================\\n\\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\\nByScott Tyler Shafer\\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\\n\\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry's first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML.
