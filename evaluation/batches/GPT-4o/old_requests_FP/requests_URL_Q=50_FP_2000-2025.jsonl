I am moved to write you this letter. \\n\\nThis was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. \\n\\nHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation\\ntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over\\n(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State\\nDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim\\nof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and\\nstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of\\nconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and\\nconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where\\nthe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nMrs. Mariam M.

I  have an urgent and  very\\nconfidential business proposition for you.\\n\\n\\nOn october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul\\nFatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq\\nand also business man made a numbered fixed deposit\\nfor 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty\\nMillions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars\\nonly in my branch.\\n\\nUpon maturity several notice was sent to him, even\\nafter the war late this year. \\nAnother notification was sent and still no response\\ncame from him. \\nWe later find out that the Governor has been\\nassasinated in Baghdad.\\n\\nThe websites below is a verification of the news about\\nhis death:\\n\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n\\n[URL]http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org[/URL]\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered\\nthat Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any\\nnext of kin in his official papers including the paper\\nwork of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me\\nthe last time he was at my office that no one except\\nme knew of his deposit in my bank.\\n\\nAccording to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign\\nand defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)\\nyears,such funds will revert to the ownership of the\\nchinese Government for financing military\\noperations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions\\nfor the military.\\n\\n\\nIn order to avert this negative development,i will\\nlike to seek for your permission as a foreigner to\\nstand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul\\nFatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will\\nnot be use for financing weapons which will further\\nenhance the courses of war in the world in general.\\n\\n\\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to\\nshare in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and\\n10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the\\ntransaction.There is no risk at all as all the\\npaperwork  for this transaction will be done by my\\nattorney and with my position as the credit officer\\nguarantees the successful execution of this\\ntransaction. If you are interested,please reply\\nimmediately.\\n\\nUpon your response, I shall then provide you with more\\n details and that will help you understand the\\ntransaction.\\n\\n\\nYou should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest\\nassured  that this  transaction would be most\\nprofitable for both of us because I shall require your\\nassistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply.\\n\\nThanks and regards.\\n\\nMr.Simon Wong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear Friend.\\n\\n\\nAttention Please,\\n\\n\\nI am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section \\nof AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. \\nWith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 50% will be for me.  Please, you have been adviced to \\nkeep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service \\nafter we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nGeorge Path.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRetrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search ! \\n[URL]http://desktop.msn.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
