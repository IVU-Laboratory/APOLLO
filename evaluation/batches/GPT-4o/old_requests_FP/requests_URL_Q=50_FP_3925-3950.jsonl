[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        Dear \\nI am Miss Franca Roland and my brother Mr David Roland, the first and only son of late Mr Mputa Roland and my aged mother, my father was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe, Before the death of my father, he had deposit the sum of US$4,000,000 (FOUR MILLION US DOLLARS), in a private security and Finance company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of chemicals and tractors for the development of our new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when the Zimbabwe president Mr Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform act, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some black farmers. This result to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society lot of people have been killed because of this land-reform act, which my father is one of them. You can hook up to CNN news every day for what is happening in the country, if you are in doubt, you can also go to the internet to [URL]www.dailynews.co.zw[/URL] , it is against this backdrop that my family and I who are currently in Dakar Senegal decided to transfer our fathers money to any foreign account since the Senegal law prohibits refugees (asylum seekers) to operate any type of bank account or to be involved in any huge financial transaction. As the eldest child of my father, I am seeking for a genuine foreign partner who can help us transfer this money into his or her oversea account. On the other hand, the senegal government seems to be playing along with them.\\nWe are therefore faced with the dilemma of investing this money in Senegal for the fear of going through the same experience in future, since both countries have similar political history. As a business man whom I will entrust my future and that of my entire family in his or her hands , I must let you know that this business is completely 100% risk-free. As we cannot accept to venture into any dangerous deal with our fortune, if you therefore accept to assist us, which I know that you will. \\nPlease I will like you to contact me through the receipt of this mail urgently. Feel free to ask all questions you deem necessary. For you assistance , we have proposed two options for you. 1)You may go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. 2)If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 15% of the sum while the remaining 85% will be my family prior for investment in your country, while the remaining 5% will be used to defray all the expenses that may incur during the process of this transaction. You are therefore required of absolute confidentiality of this matter. God bless you. Yours truly, \\nMiss Franca. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"AUS\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

We had a foreign client(name with held) who deposited a huge sum of money (US$10.5million)  with our Company.Eventually, this client was among the victims of EGYPT AIR BOEING 767  FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A but, since then  we have not had any body coming for the claims as the next of kin. A  sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the Company.  Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it overthe years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next  of kin for the past one year plus, I have removed the file to my  private volt.I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as  every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting  for a foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account.I will need  your private telephone   and fax numbers and your full name and address  of company or residential so that i can computerise them to tally with  the next of kin collum in the certificate of deposit.This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal  documentations will be handled by me. I therefore request you to  confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with  details.Lastly for the immediate take off of this transaction you have  to confirm your willingness and readiness to assist me retrive this  deposit.I look forward to hearing from you.RegardsAhmed AbuFor e-mail in Indian languages & English visit: [URL]www.e-tapaal.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief\\nsecurity advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the\\nperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the\\nadvent of a new democratic\\ndispensation in the country under the leadership of\\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under\\nsevere persecution due to the sensitive position he\\nheld in the last military regime, presently he is\\nunder house arrest restricted only to the confines of\\nhis village.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a\\nbusiness proposal that might be of interest to you. My\\nclient has informed me of the existence of funds\\ndeposited with a security company abroad. This fund\\ncame about as part of security votes that were\\nallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure\\nas chief security adviser to the then president. What\\nhappened was that he had part of the funds transferred\\nfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this\\nsecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal\\nsecurity outfit of the\\nthen president. But before the purchase could take\\nplace the president died. My client has decided to\\nkeep this for himself as all his properties has been\\nconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his\\nincarceration he cannot travel out and effect the\\nchange of possession to his benefit.\\n\\nI have been mandated by my client to source for a\\nforeign partner that can help him facilitate the\\nchange of possession. The deposit certificate and the\\ncode needed for the execution of this endeavor are in\\nmy possession.\\n\\nThe funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand\\nUnited States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.\\n\\nI remain most obliged.\\n\\nBarrister Kola Owolabi(JP).\\nPrincipal Partner.
