As usual the result is that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-) I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-) Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - Recompile the \"alsa-driver\" source rpm for your running kernel   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - Install this \"alsa-driver\" package - Install the \"alsa-libs\" package - Install the \"alsa-utils\" package Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading : [URL]http://www.alsa-project.org[/URL] (very complete and very good documentation!) Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-) Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) \"by hand\" and insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (\"dmesg\" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default. With \"aplay\" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it! It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the \"alsa-driver\" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!). I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Simply run \"xine -A alsa09\" and off you go!

Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: [URL]www.lindows.com[/URL]  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a \"Friendly-Install\" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of \"bridge\" Windows-compatible programs.

A. Hettinga\"  Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender:  [URL]http://www.siliconvalley.com[/URL] Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies ([URL]www.ceert.org[/URL] It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. --  ----------------- R. A.

In a number of cases, CO2 level increases > are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the > increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature > preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done > of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are > correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly > causative. Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal. > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2. > As it > happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. Not correct. Mauna Loa data  and  show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution). > In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: [URL]http://www.grida.no[/URL] (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\"). Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point. > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations. Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away. > Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely > predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative > feedback systems mentioned above. Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous. > Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and > methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule > basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something > that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the > biosphere. Correct. Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: [URL]http://www.grida.no[/URL] Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well. Data on water vapor here: [URL]http://www.agu.org[/URL] > CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent > studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a > passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and improved efficiency is an easy sell. - Jim\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}

That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? \\n    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads \\n    were built by English expatriates. \\n\\n    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were \\n    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's \\n    the gauge they used. \\n\\n    Why did \"they\" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways \\n    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used \\n    that wheel spacing. \\n\\n    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried \\n    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, \\n    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel \\n    ruts... \\n\\nSnopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually \\nlargely true, albeit subject to interpretation.

Linda Hemming, the award winning costume \\n    designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She \\n    wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red \\n    shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal \\n    lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell \\n    phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the \\n    premiere of \"Die Another Day,\" the new James Bond film.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \\nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \\n\\nIn its first day, I've already noticed: \\n\\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's \\nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \\nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \\nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \\n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \\nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news \\nsite, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \\nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \\n- Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them \\ncopies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have \\nto find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly. \\n\\n[1] [URL]http://news.google.com[/URL]\\n[2] [URL]http://www.concentric.net[/URL]\\n    The\\nsunrise-sunset line dividing the day and night halves of the Moon or a\\nplanet.\\n[3] [URL]http://www.slashdot.org[/URL]\\n[4] [URL]http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk[/URL]\\n[5] [URL]http://www.bluesnews.com[/URL]\\n[6] [URL]http://www.scripting.com[/URL]\\n[7] [URL]http://news.google.com[/URL]\\n[8] [URL]http://news.google.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 23, \"undetected\": 76, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 25}"}]}}
