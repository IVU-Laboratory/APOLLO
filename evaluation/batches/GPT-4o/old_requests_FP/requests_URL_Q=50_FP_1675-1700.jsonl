The problem is that \"--with  --without \" is clearly not meant to change deeply the way a package is built.

I'm not sure if it was ever used with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to remove the log statements once running. I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone. After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a very good job.

By integrating the advanced\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\\n\\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\\n\\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\\n  essential.\\n\\n  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\\n  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be\\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\\n\\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\\n  \"present.\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\\n  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\\n\\n  \"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\" says\\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. \"The powerful combination\\n  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist\\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\"\\n\\n  \"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\\n  training, support and product design,\" says David Farrington, vice president\\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \"By integrating the\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\"\\n\\n  About Magi\\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\\n  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\\n  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can\\n  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and\\n  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work\\n  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming\\n  unsecured, \"read-only\" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent\\n  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as\\n  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical\\n  interface, and universal name spaces generating \"follow me URLs\" for mobile\\n  professionals.\\n\\n  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.\\n  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing\\n  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,\\n  [URL]www.tadpole.com[/URL], which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad\\n  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

Last week, search requests\\nfor information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on\\nproducts and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space,\\nmany credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than\\nmusic, according to Wired News.  \\n---|---  \\n**2** | **Macworld:**  \\nThe annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not\\nSteve Jobs has anything real to announce. So far, it looks like Apple has\\nalready surprised a few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No.\\n7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire.  \\n**3** | **PayPal:**  \\nIt's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and PayPal deal. Soon after eBay\\nannounced it was buying PayPal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit\\nclaiming that PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being\\nsubpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its involvement with\\nonline gambling transactions.  \\n**4** | **Wi-Fi:**  \\nI'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the Buzz Meter\\npermanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact\\nbetween tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon\\nCommunications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public\\nareas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports.  \\n**5** | **eMac:**  \\nThis is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that\\nApple released it to them.

After all, while Microsoft is a giant software powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN 8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up with AOL? It just might.

One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this\\nbothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature\\ncameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But\\nwhat does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my\\nprivacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this\\ninteresting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing\\nthese miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them.\\nSo if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about\\nthis, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting\\ncaught on camera in an embarrassing situation.  \\n  \\n| ![]([URL]http://home.cnet.com[/URL]  \\n---  \\nLee Koo  \\nCNET Community  \\nGot suggestions?
