[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        My Dear Friend,\\n \\nI am Mr.George Akin,from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the \\ncourse of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) \\nfloating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as \\nfrom 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after \\ngoing through some old files in the records I discovered that \\nthe owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 \\nby plane crash, hence the money is floating.\\n\\nAfter due verification I noticed that no other person knows \\nabout this account except his wife who was also invovled in the \\ncrash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my \\ninvestigation proved to me as well that until his death he was \\nthe Director GOLD ARK [SARL]\\n \\nSince our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about \\nhis death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come \\nforward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies \\nbut up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin \\nor relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and \\nother officials in my department now decided to make this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as the \\nnext of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \\nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we \\ndon't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed \\nBill.\\n \\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used \\nas the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And \\nthe country law here does not allow such money to stay more \\nthan Five years, for the money will be recalled to the \\ngovernment treasury as unclaimed after this period.\\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the \\napplication form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I \\nwill not fail to bring to your notice that this business is \\nhitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all \\nmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five \\nbanking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the \\ndeceased.\\n \\nWhen you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail \\nsignifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers \\nfor quick communication. I will be very happy if you can treat \\nthis business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my \\nposition in this bank.\\n\\nHoping for a very successful business relationship with you.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nMr George Akin.\\n+229-909-358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\"Terminator 3: Bunt maszyn\" ju od listopada na DVD.\\n[URL]http://film.wp.pl[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"POL\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441,  WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of  what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.   My question is can the current software on my machine  use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how  much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is  for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks. Terry High quality LEADS for mlm.  Find three and get yours FREE.  Check the August Special!

Hello Nicety, I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, [URL]http://www.wonderpaint.com[/URL],   when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory  when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the  approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems,  I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much  negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer  for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's  favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I  have to make it do anything useful.  If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE  download called FreeMem which you can get here; [URL]http://www.meikel.com[/URL] This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you  also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released.  This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be  running at peak performance all the time and much easier than  constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these  little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to  search for. HTH.

Comments on Site #141:  [URL]http://www.floridarental.co.uk[/URL] Carol Hall carol@floridarental.co.uk ~~~~ Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to make your front page navigation a little less confusing? The \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark this page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not enough information on your openning page. ~~~~ I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site. 1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the animation and red text on the yellow background, missing the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more details to this important introduction. Instead of using the 'click here' button, just have a text link following directly after the introduction. 2. On the second page, have all your links the same color, and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill. 3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed menu and the pages are all untitled. I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you want the best site you can have and I think these changes will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the site you have the information organized and complete. I even wanted to come and stay! ~~~~ The animations make this site look amateurish from the beginning.  The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve this site. ~~~~ I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should have been up by the text and that is where I should go. On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that, the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page. The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good. Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten that far. ~~~~ This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich. Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste, but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that form a background for some images. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ______________________________________________________ moderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com posting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com ______________________________________________________ Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:    mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com Please send suggestions and comments to:    mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com To change your subscribed address, send both new and old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com See below for unsubscribe instructions.

Hello Nicety, I\u00a0 have to agree with Jim Shofstall, [URL]http://www.wonderpaint.com[/URL], when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441: <snip> \u00a0One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.\u00a0 When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, </snip> I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I have to make it do anything useful. If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE download called FreeMem which you can get here; [URL]http://www.meikel.com[/URL] This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be running at peak performance all the time and much easier than constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to search for. HTH.\u00a0 Tony. \t\t______________________________________________________ >>>>>> WEBSITE SHOWCASES <<<<<< Examine carefully - those with email addresses included WILL trade links with you, you are encouraged to contact them.
