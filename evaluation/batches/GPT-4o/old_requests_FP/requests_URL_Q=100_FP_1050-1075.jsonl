In recent years,\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold, studies show. \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \\n\\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and I'm disbanding it.\" \\n\\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\\n\"There's this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it's better that\\nthey end.\" \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\\nas more important. \\n\\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad. \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me.\" \\n\\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \\n\\n\"Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we're starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics.\" \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior.\" \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It's\\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend's\\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\\nLerner's patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They'll\\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\\nshe finds out.\" \\n\\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and\\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\\nisn't,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one. \\n\\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover there's something important they don't like about\\nthe other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nother's dislike criteria.\" \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \\n\\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It's also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another person's limitations.\" \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one. \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\\nget together, ever. \\n\\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while you're healthy and your life and work\\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\\n\\n[URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at [URL]http://www.nytimes.com[/URL]\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 95, \"undetected\": 5, \"harmless\": 0}, \"Blacklists\": 100}"}]}}

You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on a very remote machine.

What threat does Outlook pose to your organization? It places the company, corporate network and data at risk. Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company reputation and liability with customers at risk, and proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned. >> Have you looked into using a custom sequences file? > More detail please?
