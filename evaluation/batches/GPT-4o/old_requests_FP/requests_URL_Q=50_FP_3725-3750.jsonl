I am Dr.Faroq Uztaz, a Regional Director with Ghana Commercial Bank with regional office in Accra,Ghana. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited a huge sum of amount, US$8.5million(Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999in U.S.A. However, they were given a ceremonial mass burial near the crash site.Confirmable from the below websites:\\n[URL]www.cnn.com[/URL]\\n[URL]www.fas.org[/URL]\\n[URL]www.ntsb.gov[/URL] \\nbut, since then we have not had any body to come for the claims as the next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the bank. \\n\\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past four years , I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed off.\\n\\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain(%)would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences. \\n\\nBelieving to hear from you soonest. \\n\\nKind regards,\\nDr.Faroq Uztaz.\\n\\n\\nN:B:If interested please send your personal telephone and fax numbers.\\nThanks for your future assistance.\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        John William  61 Fann Residence Dakar Senegal E-mail:johw75@yahoo.com   Attention: The President/CEO. I am Dr John William, Bank Manager in one of the leading banks here in Dakar Senegal. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. A contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation made a numbered time Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$27,000,000.00 (Twenty seven Million Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers, Teaser Petroleum Corporation that MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany died in a plane crash along with his entire family in July 2000.PLEASE TAKE A CAREFULL LOOK AT THE BBC PUBLISHED Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK:[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]  Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigated and discovered that Mr. Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$27,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Senegal, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt governme!  nt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that I will place every necessary information about you in the late account owner\ufffds file and our computer data base as his next of kin entitled to inherit his deposited fund. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 30% for you. The remaining 20% will be for any expenses we might incurred during the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the su!  ccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, ple ase reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email address. johw75@yahoo.com   Regards, DrJohn William.\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

My \\nname is Miguel Wayne, a former merchant in Dubai, in the \\nU.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer \\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in \\ncaring for my health. \\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I \\nhave only about a few months to live, according to \\nmedical experts. I have not particularly lived my life \\nso well, as I never really cared for anyone not even \\nmyself but my business.Though I am very rich, I was \\nnever generous,I was always hostile to people and only \\nfocus on my business as that was the only thing I \\ncared for,but now I regret all this as I now know that \\nthere is more to life than just wanting to have or \\nmake all the money in the world. \\nI believe when I have a second chance to come to this \\nworld I would live my life a different way from how I \\nhad lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have \\nwilled and given most of my properties and assets to \\nmy immediate and extended family members and as well \\nas a few close friends. \\nTo correct my wrong past life, I have decided to give \\nalms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one \\nof the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have \\ndistributed money to some charity organizations in the \\nU.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \\ndeteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self \\nanymore. \\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my \\naccounts and distribute the money which I have there \\nto charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they \\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do \\nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have\\nleft for them.

The message could be strange but real, if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am Mrs. Nazek Hariri, wife of the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr Rafiq Hariri, who was assassinated on 14 February 2005, along with 20 others,near the St. George Hotel in Beirut.In the wake of his assassination on 14 February 2005, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a fact-finding mission to investigate the killing. Arriving in Beirut on 25 February, the mission interviewed Lebanese officials and politicians, from both the government and opposition, studied the Lebanese investigation and legal proceedings, examined the crime scene and collected evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt also interviewed some Witnesses.The report emphasizes that it is impossible to identify the culprits until the perpetrators have been brought to justice, but blames the Syrian government, which it charges with exerting influence that goes beyond the reasonable exercise of cooperative or neighbourly relations, with primary responsibility for the political tension that preceded the assassination, by its (interference) with the details of governance in Lebanon in a heavy-handed and inflexible manner.Since the perpetrators of these evil act has not been brought to justice, l have the feelings that l am not also save here in Beirut.\\n\\n\\n\\nI intend leaving Lebanon for greener pasture.During my husband's regime as the Prime Minister of Lebanon, He realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. The money was deposited by my husband in my name, Mrs. Nazek Hariri, in a Finance Firm in Europe. I have plans to invest this money outside Lebanon.I am contacting you because am looking for a trusted and reliable person that will represent me in Europe to claim the money on my behalf.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have sent a notification letter to the financier institution, that the consignment will be collected by the family foreign business partner.Why l need a foreign partner is that, as an Arab woman, the tradition forbids me to run any business with my son (Saadeddine). Since he was not aware of the money from the very first beginning.When I receive your positive response I will then give you details of the Finance firm, and the amount involves.\\n\\nBest regards and God bless,\\n\\nMrs.Nazek Rafiq Hariri\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nNo banners.

I am Mrs Kathy\\nOlds,wife of Late Mr Martin Olds,a famous zimbabwean\\ntobacco/cattle farmer who was murdered in a farmland\\ndispute in Zimbabwe.Please gothrough: \\n[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL] \\nI got yourcontact through a search on the internet\\nhere in South Africa. I do not know your person but I\\nam relying on faith to see me through. During the war\\nwaged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the\\nsupporters and cohorts of President Robert Mugabe to\\nclaim all the white owned farms in our country, my\\nlate husband belonged to one of the classes of farmers\\nalso targeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because he\\ndid not support theirideas and policies of taking\\nwhite farmers \\nland by force. \\n\\nBlackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my\\nhusband's house on April 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in\\nMacheke/Virginia district and murdered him because of\\nhis insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain\\ntheir farmlands despite the  recently introduced land\\nreforms\"Act\" in Zimbabwe by \\nthe head of state,President Robert Mugabe. \\nUntil his death he was one of the prominent members of\\nthe Zimbabwean Farmers'Union (ZFU)But before my\\nhusbands death, he first escaped safely into\\nneighbouring South Africa with his life time fortune\\nof US$37m(Thirty-seven Million \\nUSdollars)cash, important documents of property title\\nand other \\nvaluables which were concealed and secured in a trunk\\nbox, and \\ntransported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. \\nThe consignment box is currently safely lodged and\\nsecured in the vaults of a private security firm here\\nin Johannesburg after which he returned to zimbabwe\\nwhile he was killed. The fund was meant for the\\npurchase of new tractors,machinery and agro-allied\\nchemicals for our new farms acquired in Swaziland. \\nThis land problem came when President  Robert Mugabe\\nintroduced a new land act\"ModusOperandi\" reform which\\nwholly affected the rich white farmers. A lot of\\npeople were killed because of this land reforms \"Act\"\\nof which my late husband was one of the main\\ntargets.Based on this,I had to flee the country with\\nmy \\ntwo children and my only late husband personal\\nassistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his personal\\nassistant{PA}. \\nWe are now in south africa as political assylum\\nseekers/refugees. \\nWe decided to contact you to assist us in removing\\nthis money my husband kept in a private security\\ncompany here in south africa to your account or any\\npart of the world for investments as the\\nmonetary/investment laws here in south africa\\nprohibits refugees and illegal immigrants from\\noperating bank accounts or be involved in any\\ntransaction/investment. Based on this, \\nwe are contacting you hoping that you will assist us\\nwith this transaction. \\nAs a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility of\\nseeking a genuine and an honest person who will assist\\nus in investing this money in a highly profit yeilding\\nventures without the knowledge of my\\ncountry(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on taking\\neverything my late husband \\nhad after confiscating all his farmlands and\\ninvestments in Zimbabwe \\n. \\nWe are absolutely left with nothing except the money\\nhe deposited in a private security company here in\\nsouth africa.

Before I go into further details, please be informed that I am writing without any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will be sending to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\\nIn appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 35% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 60% is for me. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.\\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately you finish reading this mail via email. \\n \\nI await for your favorable response.\\nYours Faithfully,\\nDr. Idris Adamu.\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRetrouvez tous les services Windows Live sur votre mobile !\\n[URL]http://mobile.live.fr[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
