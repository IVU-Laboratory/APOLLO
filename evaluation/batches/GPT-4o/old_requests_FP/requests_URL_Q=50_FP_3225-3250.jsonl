[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\nHANG SENG BANK LTD.\\n\\nDES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,\\n\\nCENTRAL HONG KONG,\\n\\nHONG KONG.\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n\\n\\n Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. \\n\\n So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years and 6months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. \\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n\\n I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.\\n\\n Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\n Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\nKind Regards,\\n\\nMr. Wang  Qin\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMessage compos\ufffd depuis le module WebMail de REA S2 - [URL]http://www.reas2.ch[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Sani Abacha.  Because of my  strategic position in the former Government and also being a  close confidant  of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the  sum of  $50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only)  presently  lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money  largely through  \"CONSULTANCY FEE\" and Good Faith Fees\" paid by foreign Oil  companies prior  to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other  Lifting/prospecting Right.  Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in  the World.  As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to  Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability  has fueled  hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore  resolved to  invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties  and Importation  of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on  Investment.  However the, present civilian administration of President  Olusegun Obasanjo  has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the  cabinet of the  past military government. This is as a result of the panel of  inquiry  slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the  late former  head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the  panel  conclude its investigations which only God knows when that  would be.  Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present  two major  problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as  60% of this  money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result  of Government  deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However  arrangement  have been put in place for you to receive this money from a  trust worthy  security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate  your interest.  I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of  deposit number  and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the  onus of proof  to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic  Luggage.  All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money  on my behalf  and help me to invest as aforementioned.  There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as  the money will  be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.  If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by  email  immediately your preferred contact address where you can be  reached at any  time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in  a bank  account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the  investment of the  funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be  entitled to  25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the  proposed  company.  Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the  required contact address that include your telephone and fax  number), so  that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead  with the  transfer to you  Best regards,  Sam Aluko ------------------------------------------------------------ [URL]http://Game.37.com[/URL]  <--- Free Games [URL]http://newJoke.com[/URL]   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"CHN\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn't even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I've used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt's time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading.

Being an executor of wills, it is possible that \\nwe may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when \\nwe cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am \\npresenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his \\nnext-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died \\non the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with \\nother passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below \\nwhich was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\n WEBSITE.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co[/URL]\\nuk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm\\n \\nI am now faced with confusion of \\nwho to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune \\nis supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward \\nas the next of kin within ten years of the demise of the benefactor of \\nthe will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the \\nbeneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, \\nwhich my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I \\nalone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for \\nyou and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the \\ntsunami victims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is \\namend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the \\n$7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider \\nthis amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are \\ndocuments to back it up. \\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-\\nkin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I \\nprefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being \\ndisbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the \\nEnglish Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this \\nissue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I \\ntherefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if \\nyou decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nStephen Ayling. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.\\n\\nWe need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. \\n\\nIf you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDR MARKUS PHILLIPS.\\n\\n\\n[URL]http://xent.com[/URL]\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I know you will be surprised to read from\\nme, but please this letter is a request from a family\\nin dire need of assistance. I am Mr. Ahmed Williams\\nfrom Angola. The first and the only son of Brigadier\\nChanza Williams communicating to you from\\nJohannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nI got your address from a business directory in\\nJohannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And,\\nI, on behalf of my widowed mother Mrs. Bridget\\nWilliams decided to solicit for your assistance to\\ntransfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five\\nMillion Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars),\\nwhich he deposited in a safe box to private security\\ncompany in Johannesburg, South Africa.\\n\\nIn fact, my father said, and I quote: ?My son, I wish\\nto draw your attention to US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five\\nMillion Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).\\nI deposited the box containing the fund in a security\\ncompany in Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables.\\nDuring the war, I was very committed and dedicated in\\nwinning the war against the rebels, until I found out\\nthat the senior army officers and government\\nfunctionaries were busy helping themselves with\\ngovernment funds and properties, sending them to\\nforeign countries. Due to this, when the former\\nadviser to the president and I were assigned by the\\npresident (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in\\nSouth Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and\\ndiverted the money and share it, of which I got a\\ntotal sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million\\nEight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). In\\ncase of my absence on earth as a result of death, only\\nyou should solicit for assistance of a reliable and\\nsincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this\\nmoney out of South Africa for investment purpose. I\\ndeposited the box in your name and you can claim it\\nalone with deposited code. Your mother is with all\\nthe documents. Take good care of your mother and your\\nsisters.\\n\\n>From this words of my late father, you can understand\\nthat life and future of my family depend on this fund,\\nas such I will be grateful if you can assist us. We\\nare now living in South Africa as political asylum\\nseekers. Financial laws and regulations of the\\nRepublic of South Africa do not permit us certain\\nfinancial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest\\nthis fund in South Africa hence; I am seeking your\\nassistance to transfer this fund out of South Africa\\nfor investment purpose. For your assistance, we are\\nprepared to offer you 20% of the total fund while 10%\\nwill be set aside for any expenses incurred during\\nthis transaction.\\n\\nPlease note that this transaction is 100% risk-free\\nand the major thing I demand from you is to assure me\\nthe safety of this money when it finally gets to you.\\nFurther information and arrangement commence as soon\\nas trust confidence and good relationship are\\nestablished. I shall be most grateful if you maintain\\nthe confidentiality of this matter.

CHEUNG PUI\\n\\nHang Seng Bank Ltd\\n\\nSai Wan Ho Branch\\n\\n171 Shaukiwan Road\\n\\nHong Kong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of \\n\\noperations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.\\n\\nI have an obscured business suggestion for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years ago. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\n\\n\\n\\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below\\n\\n(cpui_hsbm01@mail2europe.com) and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegards\\n\\n\\n\\nMr.Cheung Pui\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nMail sent from Fistikmagazin.de service at  [URL]http://www.fistikmagazin.de[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED \\nTHOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)\\n\\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \\nBonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \\nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your \\ninterest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this \\ngreat business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nto the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money \\nto be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification \\nand clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole \\nmoney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking \\nlaw and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed \\nafter five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as \\nunclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is \\noccasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe \\ncannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone \\nbills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"top \\nsecret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I \\nconclude this deal with you.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in.\\n\\nAll other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from \\nyou.\\nI look forward to receive your email.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nMr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZIN\\nFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOU\\nBURKINA-FASO.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTen : profite de ton Messenger en illimit sur ton mobile !  \\n[URL]http://mobile.live.fr[/URL]\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"unknown\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

We shall employ the\\nservices of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the\\nWILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of\\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\\n \\n A bank account in any part of the world that you will \\nprovide the will, then facilitate the transfer of this \\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\\n \\n The money will be paid into your account for us to share in\\nthe ratio of 70%for me and 25% for you and 5%  for Expenses\\nIncurred in the course of the transaction\\n .\\n \\n There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this \\ntransaction will be done by the attorney and with my\\nposition as the credit officer guarantees the successful\\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, please\\nreply immediately to my email box.\\n \\n Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more \\ndetails that will help you  understand the transaction.\\n \\n Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers\\nfor easy communication.\\n \\n You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured\\nthat this transaction would be most profitable  for both of\\nus because I shall require your assistance  to invest my\\nshare in your country.\\n \\n \\n Regards,\\n Soo Cho\\n\\nN.B:Endeavour to send your reply through my alternative\\ne-mail address:soo@financesource.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"KOR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 62, \"harmless\": 37}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am the personal attorney to Late Eng. Sangeeta a national of your country, who used to work with Chevron - Development Company in Accra Ghana. Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 25th of December 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in Plane clash on cotonue. All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their lives except few people. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives. \\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. \\nI have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16.5 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next Thirty (30) Working official working days.  Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this account valued at USD16.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 30% to you and 10% will be used for any expenses.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my private email (tonywach45@yahoo.no)and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing\\nhis/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.\\n\\nThe banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. \\n\\nIn view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the\\ntransfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.\\n\\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer\\ncan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. \\n\\nWhen you receive this letter.
