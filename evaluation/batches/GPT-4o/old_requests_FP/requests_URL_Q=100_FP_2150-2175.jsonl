Then after the death of my father, we decided to \\nmove to the Republic of South Africa\\nwhere he had deposited the money in the Security Company as family \\nvaluables.\\n\\nSo, I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of \\nSouth Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any \\nbank account within South Africa. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the \\ntotal sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that \\nmay be incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and \\nmy family to invest in your country.\\n\\nAll I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal phone and fax \\nnumbers for easy communication.

With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a \\nbusiness transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end \\nof the transaction .\\n\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United \\nStates Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive \\ninformation through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement \\nto put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get \\nthe required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been \\nput in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as \\nsoon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also \\nbenefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\n\\nMr Mohamat Ali.\\n\\nMOBILE: ( 00226 78 82 97 88 )\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may \\nbe capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;\\n\\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten \\nmillion, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to \\none of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 2000  \\nin a plane crash.\\n\\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \\nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his \\nsupposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane \\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim .\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines \\nasociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \\nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nUnclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this \\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a \\nBurkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .\\n\\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \\nexpenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me and my \\ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \\ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as \\narranged,you must apply first to the bank as next of kin of the deceased \\ncustomer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the \\ntext of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \\ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \\nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\\n\\nI expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\\n\\nHoping to hear from you immediately.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\nDR .SANOU BELLO\\nAccounts & Audit Department ,\\nBank of Africa\\n\\nNb.also give me your telephone and fax numbers for easy comunication with \\nyou.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nExpress yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of \\nauditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN \\nDEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m \\nUS dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who \\ndied along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.\\n\\nSince I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of \\nkin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless \\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nanindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all \\nhis supposed next of kin or relation died alongside\\nwith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\\n\\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my \\ndepartment now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the \\nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for\\nsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t \\nwant this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\\n\\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \\nunclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \\ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\\n\\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe \\nfact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \\nof kin to a foreigner.\\nI agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, \\ninrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for \\nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after \\nI will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the \\npercentages indicated.\\n\\nTherefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, \\nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \\nindicating your bank name, your bank account number,\\nyour private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication \\nand location where in the money will be remitted .\\n\\nOn your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by \\nemail which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials \\nconfirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the \\npayment Agency. I willbe handling official\\nprotocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as \\nI am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.\\n\\nTherefore, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my\\nemail address .\\n\\nThanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.\\n\\nYours sincerely.\\n\\nMR.

Greetings to you, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you. After careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize  for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy  of The Republic of South Africa for seven years  running as you will find in the link  below: [URL]http://www.gov.za[/URL]  I will now give you a general overview of the situation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successful businessman was awarded several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with foreign investors in this field. Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husbands business which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad  and Tobago in February 2001. When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin by a private security firm in Europe to come forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At  that time, my children and I did not have an idea where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the security firm to continue holding the safety deposit until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I was going through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered a Certificate  of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private security firm, and other documents relating to the safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US Dollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generated from cash payments from his business associates in the diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium. Though I knew my late husband was in the diamond business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my children, and we have decided to have this fund invested immediately in commercial and residential properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as any member of my family cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my political status, hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your most needed assistance in this regard. If you agree to render us your assistance, your role in this project will be to act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this transaction should be based on mutuality, my family's interest will be protected by a family associate, who is a lawyer(attorney) attached to the South African Embassy in the country where the security firm is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and I have informed him that I am locating one of my husband's business associates (you) to handle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to our decision if he found out  that I barely know you. For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20 % of the funds. I thank you in advance as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be representing us, and also give you his contact for both of you to communicate and proceed with the transaction.  He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a long lasting business relationship with you. As you may  understand, due to my sensitive position in the present government, it is not safe to communicate with me via phone or fax.  This is why I have communicated with you with my private email address, and I like us to keep this way, for the safety of this transaction. whether or not you are interested in assisting us  please let us know.This will enable us make  alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part. With warm regards, Mrs. S. Shabangu. --\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"ZAF\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am Jonathan Charles from the hospitality state ( Mississippi ), an army contractor attached to the US Military force in Iraq . The reason why I\u2019m contacting you is to explain my findings to you and to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes immensely to the actualization of my dream.   \\nI am attached to the US army for the sole purpose of reconstruction work in some parts of Iraq . As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconstructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some soldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a friend whom I have known for 12 years. On the 27th day of March 2007, at about 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where there is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded to a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guided by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick the metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one another which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of them.  Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and some boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollars and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes owned and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri. I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out of the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors. \\nI am now in desperate need of a \u201cReliable and Trustworthy\u201d person like you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot afford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as everything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my picture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with. I assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the alluvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within you so that my job would not be jeopardized.

[\\SUBJECT]\n        [BODY]\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM: DAVID PEDRO.\\nNO.1023 MATIMA STREET\\nFREE STATE, SOUTH AFRICA\\nTEL: +27.785709710\\nEMAIL: davpe@myway.com\\n\\nATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.\\n\\n\\nSTRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me\\npersonally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the\\nfirst SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.\\nI was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre\\nhere in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my\\nfather, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nThis amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the\\nfarms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem\\ncame when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new \\nLand Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed \\nbecause of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.\\nIt is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.\\n\\nI am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in \\nSouth Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since \\nboth countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African \\nForeign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker. \\nAs a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his \\nhands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept \\nto assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any\\naccount you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into \\npartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your \\ncountry. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have \\nalso mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the \\nprocess of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I \\nImplore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact  me on this  mail direct  email:davpe@myway.com\\n\\nAnd send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:\\n1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.\\n2) YOUR FULL NAME.\\n3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.\\nPLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY FATHER DIED, \\nFROM THE LINKS BELOW.\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\n[URL]http://news.bbc.co.uk[/URL]\\nTHANKS FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION\\nEMAIL: davpe@myway.com\\nDAVID PEDRO (FOR THE FAMILY)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhora tambi&eacute;n puedes acceder a tu correo Terra desde el m&oacute;vil.\\n\\nInf&oacute;rmate pinchando aqu&iacute;.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"GBR\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 25, \"harmless\": 75}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}
