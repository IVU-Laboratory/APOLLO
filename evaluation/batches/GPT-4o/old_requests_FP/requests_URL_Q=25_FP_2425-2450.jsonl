I am the above named\\nperson. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I?m now in Nigerian\\nGeneral HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy\\nin LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were  \\nmarried for\\neleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for\\nonly four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his\\ndeath I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home\\nwhich the Bible is against.\\n\\nWhen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten\\nMillion five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this  \\nmoney is\\nstill under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently,  \\nmy Doctor\\ntold me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer\\nproblems.\\n\\nThough what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided\\nto donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual\\nThat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a\\nchurch that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows\\npropagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.\\nThe Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took\\nthis decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and\\nmy husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard\\nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this\\nmoney will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold\\ndecision.\\n\\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going\\nto be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight\\nmy case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in\\nthis regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's\\nrelatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.\\nWith God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward\\nyour personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address,  \\nwith Your\\ntelephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal\\nowner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your\\nnominated Bank Account in your country.\\n\\nI will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as  \\nthe real\\nnext of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and  \\nthe church\\nto always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me\\nthat you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My\\nhappiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to\\nserve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful\\nall through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching\\nfor a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me\\nthat you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as\\nsoon as possible.\\n\\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\\n\\nYours in Christ,\\n\\nMrs. Sussan Adams\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Conectese mas rapido y ahorre hasta un 50%\\n    Tel. 0909.2030 =>  $0,15 IVA incluido el minuto\\n______________________________________________________\\n[URL]http://www.internet.com.uy[/URL] - En Uruguay somos internet\\n\\n\\n\\n\n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"URY\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I have decided to contact you on a business \\ntransaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the \\ntransaction .\\n\\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a \\nplane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank \\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or \\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\\n\\nThe said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand \\nUnited States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your \\nimpressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole \\narrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the \\ndeceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign \\naccount has been put in place and directives and needed information will be \\nrelayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to \\nassist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.\\n\\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign \\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will \\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin \\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \\naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \\nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the \\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \\nto your own designation bank account.\\n\\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On \\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the \\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of \\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and \\ninternet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have \\nbeen adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to \\nretire from service after we conclude this deal with you.\\n\\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm \\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for \\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated \\nand further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us \\nto invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when \\nI hear from you.\\n\\nI look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMusa Garuba.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon't just search.

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER BANK OF AFRICAN . OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. WEST AFRICA Dear  , how are you,first i will explain my self in brief for you before we proceed.I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICAN (BOA)  I am writing to Seek your interest over a business , In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15.5m US dollars (fifteen million five US dollars). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 15th 2001 in a plane crash at abidjan cote'voire. Since we  got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless his next of kin or relative applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my department now  decided to excape with the fund,and as such we vial to make this business proposal to you so that my bank will release the fund into your account as the next of kin to our bank deceased customer for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for claims and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury. Infact i know the fund will not even go into the bank treasury,but our top bank officials(directors)will only share it among themselves into their accounts. The Banking law and guideline here in burkina faso stipulates that if any customer account or property remains unserviceable or dormant,and unclaimed after five years, the account will be confiscated and transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,inrespect to the provision of a foreign account,and your imense contribution to champion the course of transfering the fund to your  account.  10 % will be set aside forexpenses incurred by the both party during the business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable my bank transfer the fund into your account,i will send to you the text of application which you will send to my bank as next of kin to the deceased customer and that will be when you indicate your interest in the business, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of our bank deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction  is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required informations will be perfectly made for you to champion the course of the transaction with my bank without any hitch or risk . You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your\u2019s sincerely, DR ASINTHE NIGNAN.

I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as reported by the International media.\\n\\nI wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.\\n\\n[URL]http://www.rte.ie[/URL]\\n\\nhtml This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison.\\n\\nHaving lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country.\\n\\nI have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States Dollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know of the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the knowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk boxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then deposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic courier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic checks at the ports. \\n\\nThe reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be transferred without any problems.\\nFor now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the security company.\\n\\n Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and should\\nalso be handled in the most confidential manner.\\n\\nI have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. \\n\\nIf for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for the investment in your country.\\n\\nSo based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my contact andexistence of my fund a secret.\\n \\nI also require you to make available to me the following\\n \\n1)Your Complete name.\\n \\n2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with you easily.\\n \\n Sincerely Yours,\\n\\nHASSAN   GEORGE   .\\n  \n        [\\BODY]\n        \"\"\"\n    \n\n             ######\n\n             URL Information:\n             {\"Server location\": \"USA\", \"VirusTotal scan\": {\"malicious\": 0, \"undetected\": 81, \"harmless\": 18}, \"Blacklists\": 0}"}]}}

I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.\\nJohn Anderson a foreigner, who was a contractor to Shell Petroleum\\nDevelopment Company in Nigeria(SPDC). On the 26th of September 1992, my\\nclient, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plane crash on\\ntheir way to Yankari Games Reserve for 2week`s holiday.\\n\\nUnfortunately they all lost their lives in the plane crash, Since then I\\nhave made several enquiries to his Embassy and the home address he filled\\nin his file in my office to locate any of his extended relatives, this has\\nalso proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I\\ndecided to use the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no\\navail, hence I contacted you.\\n\\nI contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left\\nbehind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable\\nby the SECURITY & FINANCE HOUSE where this fund is deposited. Particularly,\\nthe FINANCE HOUSE where the deceased had an account valued at about US$9M\\n(Nine million dollars). Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide\\nthe next of kin or have the account confiscated.\\n\\nsince I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 10 years\\nnow. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased\\nsince you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at\\nUS$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and\\n40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be\\nincurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your\\ncountry.\\n\\nI have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any\\nclaim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us\\nseeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a\\nlegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nBarrister Vincent Usman(Esq).\\n\\nN.B.
