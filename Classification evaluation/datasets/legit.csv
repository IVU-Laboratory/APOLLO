1612;"""Sven"" <sven@dmv.com>";<Razor-users@example.sourceforge.net>;Wed, 9 Oct 2002 23:37:05 -0400;[Razor-users] razor vs cloudmark - merging?;"I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP for
whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.
The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call?

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by
the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and
the likes).

Hi, First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week, but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this! - Is this with different DVDs or a single one? - Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both? - Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones? I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up. In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example : rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY (this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages) Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to ensure integrity with the way things curently work.

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

1609;Samuel Checker <sc@pffcu.org>;<razor-users@example.sourceforge.net>;Wed, 9 Oct 2002 09:15:03 -0400 (EDT);[Razor-users] Razor and Pine;"I've been testing Razor, invoked from sendmail/procmail and so far it
seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.

This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.

Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?

Having recently checked out both of these, for a selection of
books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

The books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)

I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.

Cheers,
Dave.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

The likelyhood of EFF or other mailing lists getting filtered will
decrease over time as these mails are revoked whenever they get filtered
out. Revocations help the system to punish reporters who report legit bulk
mail such that their future reports are automatically considered suspect.
As such, with all the new changes to TeS, the likelyhood of filtering
mailing list posts has decreased dramatically. Please keep me posted if
you see false positives on the EFF newsletter again.

cheers,
vipul.

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last two
days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to the
upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to normal.
Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy, specially with
regards to false-positives.

cheers,

Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2 it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list;1;0

Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your problem. What you need to know for openssl is : 0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0 0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1 0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2 Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on those files and not on ""openssl = version"".

8/29/02

Dear friends,

I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? 

I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" 

I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. 

They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin.""

My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. 

                      *        *       *       *       *        *

Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. 

It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.

                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *

My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.

I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die.

The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...)

The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for.

I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone.

                 *          *          *          *          *          *

I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
all.""

They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll.""

""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""

""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""

That is my father. That was my mother.

I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.

I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.

Again, many thanks,

ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks


Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.

The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.

While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.

""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved.""

The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.

EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.

The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.

The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.

But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.

Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure.""

The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.

Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.

Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""

Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""

The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.";1;0

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.

I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.

BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

A. Hettinga""  Subject: Re: Electric car an Edsel... Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2002 22:49:20 -0600 Bob, This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well thought out. Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!

You get _exactly_ the same problem with Suse and RedHat, is that right?
What versions of these have you used?

1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?

2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the BIOS.  Is the cdrom external
or strange in some way?

 University boom creates era of sexual tolerance

 By Helen Rumbelow
 
 
 
 THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in Britains
 tolerance of homosexuality, according to a report. Just under half the people
 now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong, down from three
 quarters 15 years ago, according to the British Social Attitudes survey,
 regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion. 
 
 That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities, with 75 per
 cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced, compared
 with 60 per cent in 1987. 
 
 Geoffrey Evans, a politics professor at Oxford University, decided to focus on
 what has caused Britain to become more open-minded in a report published
 today. The study, from the National Centre for Social Research, is based on
 interviews with a cross-section of 3,500 people. 
 
 Young people are much more tolerant than their elders, with a quarter of
 twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong, compared with
 two thirds of pensioners. 
 
 But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college, with
 graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs, and a
 third less racist. 
 
 That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from
 and, with 41 per cent of young people now attending university, it was a
 powerful social effect, Professor Evans said. 
 
 Mr Blairs famous mantra education, education, education seems far less
 consequential now than when first announced in 1997, as Britain struggles with
 an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people
 get degrees, degrees buy less and less, he said. 
 
 But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the
 undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance, he added. 
 
 He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just
 political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would
 give to an unattractive minority: white supremacists. 
 
 Again, people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and
 university, with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists
 should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections,
 three times as many as those with no qualifications. 
 
 It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant, the report
 says, adding that it may be simply because university students have increased
 contact with alternative points of view. 
 
 Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their
 idealism, but found the opposite to be true. 
 
 Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong
 with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties. He
 said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older
 generation, Britain would become an ever more relaxed place. 
 
 Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability, with more than half
 the country wanting cannabis to be legalised, compared with a third seven
 years ago. That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread,
 with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it. 
 
 A third of Labour voters, twice as many as Conservatives, had tried the drug,
 and being young, living in London and having a degree also increased the
 chances. 
 
 One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs. Most take a strong position on
 heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years. Now the proportion of
 people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept
 up to 97 per cent. 
 
 The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal
 free-for-all, Alison Park, co-director of the study, said. People are making
 quite a clear distinction between what they think (of) as right and wrong. 
 
 On other matters, the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think
 that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits  in
 fact, they account for 6 per cent; that union membership has fallen by a fifth
 in the past 18 years, with just under a third of workers in a union; and that
 half those questioned oppose secondary school selection. In 1984 the figure
 was 40 per cent. 
 
 The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live
 with their parents, twice as many as women.

Now this is probably of no use to you whatsoever, but...

Not a deb-head, but I also have a problem regards NVidia. I've two machines,
pretty much the same hardware. 
athlon 1700XP's, both have NVidia cards, one Gforce3 Ti and a Gforce2MX,
both use the same driver module. 

Both have same kernel version albeit it compiled for their particular
hardware.

One works perfectly, the other fails to load. When I check with lsmod, I can
see the NVdriver is loaded, but not used ;--(
Thus when I startx, it bombs out. 

IU still have X with the default nv driver and crappy accelleration -->
650fps with glxgears [should be over 2000fps]
Its not a hardware issue with the cards as I swapped them over and get the
same symptoms. 

I reckon my mobo is cack, I've tried swapping slots around, reserving
resources etc all to no avail. 
Should there be an interrupt for the nv card? I haven't checked the other
box yet.

Regards,
CW

If X is working and you get a brief Nvidia splash screen then this is
likely nothing to do with the driver itself.  You should be able to use kdm
or gdm with the nvidia Xserver.  What exactly did you change in your
XF86Config?  Will gdm/kdm not start?

Well, this sounds like the NVIDIA kernel module isn't loading on boot.
When it *is* working do a quick 

/sbin/lsmod

and look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver').  Then put this on
a new line in 

/etc/modules

in order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do

modprobe nvdriver

to load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the
driver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the
nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not
open source).

The nvidia driver source is in the Woody tree.

http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/nvidia-kernel-src.html

so you can do

apt-get install nvidia-kernel-src

and then compile, although I've always gone the route you're doing now.

Ideally the nvidia driver would be a part of the kernel from day 1.
However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is
pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific
kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did).  As
debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package
and have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if
they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.

I am not using procmail because this [cluster of] server is a gateway on to
5 different pop3 servers (5 different domains), ergo, local users won't work

Alternatively does anyone have a working, high-capacity milter for this or

Irish is taught badly in schools. But then again so is French. I did 3 years
of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. 

The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...

I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).

Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)

15 seconds is more than enough timeout... There's no request/minute limit,
and we are not close to hardware limits on any of the servers.

Could you send me relevant sections from the log file as well as
your config?

Yup. It's alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++ Sorry about that.

I've never used the group, so I can't vouch for it's usefulness.
But a few people I respect a lot direct people there for beginner

XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input  mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,  which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which  apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---  implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII  input mode (what us English-speakers would call ""normal""  keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).

While I am in Linux, the following message is the output when I
execute fdisk /mbr, even though the drive is in read and write mode:

Unable to open /mbr

The mbr is on a separate drive -- not related to the Linux drive.

Prepare LILO to boot the new disk    (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)    We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot    Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration.

fdisk /mbr will restore a dos MBR.. it'll leave the partitions alone.

linux fdisk and deleting all partitions will actually leave LILO in the
MBR though.

but I don't see any responses. I get that error when calling razor-report
from a sendmail alias, but not from the command line as a different user.
The way I solved it was to run 

razor-admin -create

and

razor-admin -discover

with a -home argument set to the global /etc/razor directory, which is
explicitly specified in the args to the alias pipe.

The manual page, which suggests that /etc/razor/razor-agent.conf will be
loaded first, does not also say that razor-admin will then create a
.razor directory in the user's home directory if it does not exist
(although this /is/ pointed out in the razor-agents(1) page. This may
lead to some minor confusion if the user is trying to set the discovery
and other defaults for a default (e.g., /etc/razor) install. The
workaround is as I say above, namely, explicitly specify the path to
razorhome on the command line, e.g.

razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -create
razor-admin -home=/etc/razor -discover

 Ah right. Actually, sysctl -a was more helpful - shows why setting
sys.fs.files-nr didn't work..

If you'll look closely, I said the Forest Service official claimed it was 
the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at 
least partially responsible.  The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service 
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These 
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that 
resulted from previous management policies.

In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from 
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover 
lawsuits.

Exactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that 
stuff.  The result:  Fires like Cerro Grande.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days.  Those that are, 
are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.

Boy, that is rather strange. I've always been under the impression that
the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to ""let-it-burn"".

The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.

40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. 

I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.

Try the following newsgroups - 
Beginners:
news:comp.lang.learn.c-c++

More advanced: 
news:comp.lang.c
news:comp.lang.c++
news:comp.lang.c.moderated

Also, you should keep a bookmark pointing at the comp.lang.c FAQ at 
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html

For tutorials, the guy who maintains the clc FAQ (Steve Summit)
has a tutorial - http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html
Also you could have a look at the excercises he poses - all
linked from http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html

For C++, I would guess that the comp.lang.c++ FAQ is a good place
to start - they're likely to have links to suggested reading
material.

If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd
edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie), for C++ the equivalent book
is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)

Hope this helps,

Well, I'm hardly a Gaeilgir, but in general I wouldn't consider
either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or
English.

if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if they throw in anthems or
politics, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
perspective, but i'll only do that with my critical thinking cap on.
just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).
if that sort of thing didn't stick at the age of five, i severely doubt
it will stick now.

there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in

Going rapidly OT here, but I find it shocking that anybody could be
proud of not knowing something. It's like the tourist on holidays using
that speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly
less off-topic) the friend or relative who says ""I know nothing
about computers!"" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy
to let you clean up after them.

I certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't
when I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to
count it as one of my skills.

and don't forget the c iaq.  that's here:

    http://www.plethora.net/~seebs/faqs/c-iaq.html

an example:

    1.3: If I write the code int i, j; can I assume that (&i + 1) == &j?

    Only sometimes. It's not portable, because in EBCDIC, i and j are not

That won't work like you want.  You'll end up with a boot loader
on the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of
the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
be the same as the backup disk.

I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.

GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
for you though...

The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you
have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.

It was one of the worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200 crew members survived. Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic story a startling new twist. It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made the sinking possible. Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58 surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And, they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds. Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six torpedoes sent it to the bottom. ""It was sheer chance,"" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. ""Without that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the cruiser, especially at that distance."" With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a university honors course called ""Astronomy in Art, History and Literature."" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the moon in military and other encounters. Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright star in van Gogh's ""White House at Night."" He and some students went to Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was completed in June 1890. Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed, and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then identified the ""star."" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June had occupied that part of the sky. A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the middle of the month that year. Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the opening of ""Hamlet,"" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the ""star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns."" From the guards' description, the season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars. Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star, for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia, creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the source of some of his best-known plays. Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other astronomy-based sleuthing. Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic ""Moon and Half Dome."" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at 4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960. Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of ""Moon and the Half Dome"" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual moon and the Half Dome. Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly rapid movement of the moon described in ""The Merchant's Tale"" occurred in April 1389. And in ""The Franklin's Tale,"" Chaucer's description of the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur astronomer. Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride, how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that, while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat. Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining ""the tide that failed"" in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943. Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with drafts of at least four feet, to pass. But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, ""the ocean just sat there,"" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600 yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun fire from the Japanese. Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the military planners were aware that they had to contend with a ""neap"" tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes water levels to deviate less. But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed and the marines in trouble. ""I'm not in the least blaming the planners,"" Dr. Olson said, explaining that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been applied to the waters at Tarawa. Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, ""We can calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history."" Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. ""I have thought about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,"" he says, ""and that has made my life as a scientist much richer."" http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork";1;0

This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov  ----- From: Vladimir Katalov  Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov  Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html?tag=fd_top By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PT WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system. In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it ""could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years"" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system. HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books. If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that ""is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection"" of copyrighted works. On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias ""Phased,"" said in the message: ""Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job."" That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

that I'm healing quickly. My body is very strong and doing really well. My
blood pressure is great. Heart rate is great. Cholesterol needs work and I
have to lose a bunch of weight, and of course I can't smoke. Now the bad news.
I have to be a saint for the rest of my life. I knew this day was coming. As I

![A picture named

to Glenn Reynolds for the link to metsonline.net. As a Mets fan since 1962, I
think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan
Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there
isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I
totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money.
The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major
League Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for
free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over
by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves
based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another
side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please
remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this
website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.

System :: Archiving :: Backup
System :: Archiving :: Compression
System :: Filesystems

About: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

Changes: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

Multimedia :: Graphics
Printing

About: Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and two drivers (traditional and
IJS-based) for Ghostscript that may be compiled into that package. This
driver package is Foomatic-compatible and provides Foomatic data to enable
plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of
Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the
quality of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.

Changes: This release fixes a serious and longstanding problem whereby
prints to certain Epson printers hosted on a Windows system are
incomplete; the bottom of the last page of the print is chopped off. There
are also some minor tweaks for the Epson Stylus Photo 2100/2200.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 12:47

Internet
System :: Monitoring

About: Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.
The hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP
personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain
versions of operating systems. Honeyd enables a single host to claim
multiple addresses on a LAN for network simulation. It is possible to ping
the virtual machines, or to traceroute them. Any type of service on the
virtual machine can be simulated according to a simple configuration file.
Instead of simulating a service, it is also possible to proxy it to
another machine.

Changes: UDP support (including proxying), and many bugfixes.

System :: Archiving :: Packaging
System :: Installation/Setup
System :: Logging

About: IPFS (IPSquad Package From Source) is a system which allows you to
trace an program's installation from sources and register it in your
favorite packaging system. (Only Slackware 8.1 is currently supported.)

added files, and then registers them in the chosen packaging system as if
the install was made from a normal package. Unlike other similar products,
IPFS is able to track both shared and statically linked programs. A
Slackware 8.1 package for IPFS is available for download. 

Changes: The old resolve_path shell script has been replace with a newer
and faster ipfs_realpath coded in C.

[046] - Lindenmayer Systems in Python 1.0 
  by Eleventh Hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:52

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence
Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Text Processing :: General

About: Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of
Lindenmayer systems (also called ""L-systems"" or ""substitution systems"").
In basic form, a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. In addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Operating System
Text Processing

About: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++
and shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a
configuration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,
and optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.

in before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP l2 is a C library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
Unix logging facility. It is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 
  by Joo Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34

Communications :: Usenet News
Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

About: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its
main objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software
(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

Changes: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone
MySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for
Phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:15

Communications :: BBS
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: Message Boards

About: PHPTalk aims to be the fastest and most configurable multithreaded
message board system available. It has the usual features like
multithreading, auto indexing of messages (for searching), customizable
colors, etc. However, PHPTalk differs in that it allows you to easily
integrate it into existing sites. It does this by not relying on specific
display files, allowing you to template most of the frontend, and allowing
you to specify an already existing user table. Also included is a DBI for
portability, ANSI SQL for portability, an advanced and documented API,
full multilingual support, and full i18n support for date functions. 

Changes: This release has migrated to PEAR. It has an expanded API, major
code cleanups, increased i18n support, and many minor bugfixes.

  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 23:04

Software Development :: Testing

About: Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

Changes: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: ""insane instruction 27: PUTFL
%ecx"", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red
Hat ""Limbo"" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

provided in the library for other applications which need to maintain
virtual domain email accounts. It supports named or IP-based domains. It
works with vqadmin, qmailadmin, vqregister, sqwebmail, and courier-imap.
It supports MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, LDAP, and file-based (DJB constant
database) authentication. It supports SMTP authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. It supports user quotas and roaming users (SMTP
relay after POP authentication). 

Changes: This release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for BSD users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
Maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and
updates the documentation.

[095] - Vstr string library 0.9.9 
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:14

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la ""C strings"". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: The vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. Work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

About: The goal of the WallFire project is to create a very general and
modular firewalling application based on Netfilter or any kind of
low-level framework. Wfconvert is a tool which imports/translates rules
from/to any supported firewalling language.

Changes: This release adds support for service ""macros"" in WallFire's
native language, a ""disabled"" flag for a rule, and MAC addresses class
handling. Man pages now install properly, and the whole thing compiles
under g++-3.1.

[100] - WebFileManager 0.972 (Stable)
  by horsburgh (http://freshmeat.net/users/horsburg/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 16:56

Desktop Environment :: Window Managers
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: FileManager is a secure (SSL), multi-user, and Web- based program
for file, directory, and remote  command management. It is written in
Perl, for  Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It displays  full
directory information; allows file viewing,  deleting, renaming,
uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
FileManager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

Changes: A security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. The security certificate has been extended.
Support has been added for 29 more OS types. The find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. A new option controls whether or not a user
can ""click"" outside their home directory tree. The AllowRootUser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. A bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a ""group"" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the ""Command Line"" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.

  by Klayton Monroe (http://freshmeat.net/users/mavrik/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 13:19

Security
System :: Monitoring
System :: Systems Administration

About: WebJob downloads a program over HTTP/HTTPS and executes it in one
unified operation. The output, if any, may be directed to stdout/stderr or
a Web resource. WebJob may be useful in incident response and intrusion
analysis as it provides a mechanism to run known good diagnostic programs
on a potentially compromised system. It can also support various
host-based monitoring solutions. 

Changes: Under the hood, the project went through some significant
restructuring, primarily to make room for three new platforms: NT/2K,
Cygwin, and MacOS X. The default installation directory has changed for
Unix platforms (it is now in /usr/local/integrity).

  by Jiri Tobisek (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobich/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:39

Text Editors

About: The goal of the XMLtype project is to create a console-based editor
of XML document-oriented files in UTF-8 encoding. It is designed from the
beginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts
(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and
fast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to
compete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full
functionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being
developed under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal. 

Changes: This release fixes an ugly I/O bug caused by previous bugfixing.

I am now preparing a small patch to configure.in for NetBSD (possibly
also useful for Open- and FreeBSD, don't know). Should be ready and
tested in the next half hour.

If you think 2.40 is ready, I would suggest to wait just 24 hours more
for possible reports by b2_4_0 users. Not everyone can follow the
development during daytime (at work).

However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are. Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks"" (high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out. >>>Chris Garrigues said:  > > From:  Brent Welch   > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700  > >  > >   > > >>>Robert Elz said:  > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the  > >  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  > >   > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify  > time,  > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to  > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  >   > Do you really think this is true?

I'm not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots, and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at, all the time...

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things that I never saw happen).

Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 

At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 

Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 

But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 

""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 

""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 

'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 

""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 

Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 

Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 

Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 

One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 

He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 

Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 

There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 

Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 

Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 

More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 

One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 

But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 

But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" 

Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 

Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 

After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 

He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 

Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 

She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 

He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 

He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 

""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 

As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 

""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""
Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

Habeus -- Why?;"Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get. Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark. Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars.

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

Header forgeries are trivially easy to detect. The main way that 
spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, 
but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that 
spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the 
originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, 
and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many 
ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.

One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, 
and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a 
fairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his 
meatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once 
you have legal recourse to subpoena records.

I recently cleaned my spam corpus from them but these are my current 
results:
   OVERALL        SPAM     NONSPAM  NAME
     13929         995       12934  (all messages)

I put it into cvs_rules_under_test, let's see what the 2.41 GA run thinks 
about it :)

Things aren't all that bad. I remember Vancouver
as having a broad variety of good, local eateries.
And Toronto as having a variety of good, local
strip joints. ;-) I never ate a doughnut in
Canada, so I cannot vouch for their quality. I
could live in either of these cities quite happily,
but Carolyn doesn't like cold weather.

Personally, I almost never eat at a franchise
restaurant. Usually you can find better fare or
cheaper fare (and often both!) at a local
restaurant.

Many spammers make money not from response to the spam, but from selling
the service of spamming on behalf of someone else.  You might track down
whoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be
more difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
they haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,
not to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with
the whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be
held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.

There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are planning 
on making money from the spam.  What a court would consider evidence of being 
the spammer is another question.

You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:

1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.

2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.

I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:

OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME
  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)
      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWE

The score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.

Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking that  it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in  the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that 
it was factually inaccurate.  Did you actually read it or did you just assume 
that if the Grauniad writes about a Muslim extremist they must be making him out 
as an all round nice guy?

Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'

Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

(It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. This one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl	Wed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@      set seq {}      set rseq {}      foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { +	if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { +	    # just ignore anything bogus +	    continue; +	}  	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]  	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {  	    lappend seq $parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue"" if you like, but I don't think an error is needed). But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before. If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it, I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it. And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway, so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead. So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course. And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G). Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the ""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then). kre --- select.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl	Wed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@      bindtags $w [list $w Entry]      bind $w 	{SelectTypein %W %A}      bind $w 	{SelectToggle %W } +    bind $w 	{SelectPrev %W }      bind $w 	{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w 	{SelectComplete %W}      bind $w 	{SelectReturn %W} +    bind $w 	{SelectReturn %W %A}      bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W}      bind $w 	{SelectBackSpace %W} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@      append select(sel) $a      Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)""      if ![info exists select(folder)] { -	Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +	catch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }      }  }  proc SelectBackSpace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@  proc SelectToggle {w} {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +	if {$select(sel) != """"} { +	    SelectTypein $w + +	    return +	}  	set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]  	set select(prompt) ""[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:""      } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@      }      Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)""  } +proc SelectPrev {w} { +    global select +    if [info exists select(folder)] { +	SelectTypein $w ""-"" +    } else { +	catch { +	    incr select(sel) -1 +	    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow +	} +        Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" +    } +}  proc SelectComplete { w } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@  	Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)""      }  } -proc SelectReturn { w } { +proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { +	if {$a != {}} { +	    SelectTypein $w $a +	    return +	}  	if [info exists select(match)] {  	    set select(sel) $select(match)  	    unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@  	unset select(folder)      }      $select(entry) configure -state disabled +    Exmh_Status """"      Exmh_Focus  }  proc SelectClear { w } { _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers";1;0

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 

The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 

Speaking in tongues 

""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 

 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 

""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. 

The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 

The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. 

Slow system 

For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 

The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 

""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 

The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 

But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. 

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.


Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. 

""But it's not, they are really out there."" 

'Cats with cubs' 

Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. 

Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. 

The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 

But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 

""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 

'Trigger camera' 

The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 

But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 

A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 

Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself."" 

'Like dogs' 

The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. 

Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. 

""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo.""

Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the 
""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.

Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.

The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.

 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda

 A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"". 

 The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

Close encounter of burnt kind

IT came from outer space  or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation  that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed  because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added.

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

There's a book come out recently on the world's undeciphered scripts

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.

Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference. Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids  to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those  messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have changed. Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of  one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.   In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence. If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.

Actually, it was worse - a bodycheck showed up a ""remove"" URL. I
need a new spam filter (but I want to be able to process false

Can someone please tell me what a ""pitch"" constitutes? I have an idea 
it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
more formal.
------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has  been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to  sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a  one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages  removed.

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and  Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it  only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the  ""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences  are actually reread from disk. My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.

I think everybody has their own version of this,
but in case it's useful.. (only tested on Linux):

find $* \( -type f -o -type l \) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 |
xargs -r0 du -b --max-depth 0 |
sort -k1n |
grep -v ""^0""

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.
Carlos

Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
is probably working.

Just for the record mc has a nice directory
comparison function. This is really nice
when using the ftp VFS for e.g. Of course
if you use something like ftpfs you can use
the previously mentioned tools.

Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.

Pro-hunt activists target top sight

ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA)  a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance  admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn  which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a
lorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.""
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job.""
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.""
An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good.""
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.""
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established - there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants, but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created  much more easily within the petrochemical industry. Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world  war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants.  Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as  petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication  of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately  matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to  cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants. My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason. Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely  difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen, just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on, for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers. All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.

 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY

WELCOME to Crop Idol  your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 


The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.


Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.

Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).

Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.


Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers  while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =


Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 

Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.

Theories about their cause include whirlwinds  known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes  earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.

In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.

Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.

""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them.""

Also I notice this story shows the truth - the  Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just  a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about  Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military  HQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.' Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh  Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html  *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that  would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy  surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft   released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every  Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the  right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice   and Industry Canada  , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step  in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to  conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion  draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in  early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,  Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and  combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting  these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the  Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty  , which the country is in the  process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the  possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet  providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and  permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden  electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In  most circumstances, a court order would be required for government  agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of  Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have  endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty  , which has  drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.  Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted  ,  or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist , a professor at the  University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the  justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems  weak. ""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the  changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to  make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing  argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,  make that case."" Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new  powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant  number of cases where police have run into problems."" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is  compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure  their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention  orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the  Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act  , but it  applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. ""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and  Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical  capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national  security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be  responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center   (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says  the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their  proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not  just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals  only with computer data."" EPIC opposes    the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and  does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs  of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with  personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The  implementation of such a database would presuppose that service  providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,""  the draft says. Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an  activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea."" ""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous  mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet  anonymously,"" Hosein said. A representative for George Radwanski  , Canada's privacy commissioner, said  the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on  the paper as it stands."" Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca   no later than Nov. 15.";1;0

As usual the result is that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-) I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-) Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - Install this ""alsa-driver"" package - Install the ""alsa-libs"" package - Install the ""alsa-utils"" package Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading : http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ (very complete and very good documentation!) Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-) Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default. With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it! It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!). I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages! Download : http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/ Current spec files : http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec (All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ ) Matthias PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support!

To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

A. Hettinga""  Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender:  http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org). It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. --  ----------------- R. A.

Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal. > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2. > As it > happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. Not correct. Mauna Loa data  and  show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution). > In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record""). Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point. > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations. Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away. > Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely > predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative > feedback systems mentioned above. Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous. > Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases.

Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well. Data on water vapor here: http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html > CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent > studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a > passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and improved efficiency is an easy sell. - Jim";1;0

Ben Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link

    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 

    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 

    Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 

    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts...

    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two 
    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my 
    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
was one. Google News[1] is another. 

In its first day, I've already noticed: 

- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
- Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. &#8220;So, the answer to the 
question that started this whole project, ""what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?"" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; 
- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. 
&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? 
Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or 
may not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of 
parsing FOAF files. 
- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce 
RDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of 
tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make 
heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have 
been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1]. 

    A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feeling of loss.

_Sam Ruby_: Stark raving mad[1]. 

    This post was entered in Radio, extracted using a batch file via some 
    UserTalk, parsed using Perl, cleaned up by tidy and a C program of my own 
    design, transferred to intertwingly using scp, and then ssh triggers 
    unpacking on the destination site, where a shell script takes over: invokes 
    indexing using Jakarta's Lucene, and then a python script pings weblogs.com 
    and blo.gs. 

Tom Stoppard (_Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_): 

    Guildenstern: &#8220;A man talking sense to himself is no madder than a man

_Anil Dash_: XML version 1.0[1]. &#8220;Why isn't there a way to syndicate my 
words without butchering the way they look?&#8221; Several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason 
Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside 
joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in 
general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's 
forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to 
insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. 

_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format 
formerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. 

_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war 
between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. 
So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It 
isn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type 
doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an 
impediment to mainstream acceptance. 

_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS 
0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my 
RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:&#8221; 

    *RSS not supported here* 

    This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to 
    view entries, may I suggest that you visit the weblog, and save your fast 
    skimming for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

Recently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important 
service, as far as I'm concerned: real-time song info from their 
website. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls 
intermittently); and I'm surely not going to fire up my projector while 
listening to the ""radio"", so I'm quite happy that I can retrieve r/t 
song info with URLs like:

http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/soundsoftheseasons.asp
http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/rap.asp
http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/opera.asp
etc...

Now, if I were a more eager hacker, I'd write up little WSDL stubs for 
these event streams (they're clearly not worried about load, since their 
own web pages specify 15 sec meta-refresh) and then feed 'em through a 
content router to alert me to cool songs. Heck, cross-reference the 
service to CDDB and... :-)

I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
before.
I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
gateway.
It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
internal domains...

Suggestions would be appreciated.

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:  to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). 				  -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.   Reasons:   nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on   a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls   getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).   Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead   of SMTP.   Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not   recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail   delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use   sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:     .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv   which creates problems:     Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error     Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error     Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.   ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.       It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout     about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to     being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.     Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a     non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's     current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in     /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's ""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:   0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:     DATADIR     ALLOW_MODE_640     CRYPT_KEY_FILE     FINGERPRINT   1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".   2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.   3) Set the following options in exim.conf:     message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""     message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe   4) /etc/exim/filter reads:     # Exim filter     testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""     testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""     if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and         ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and        ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""     then       pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""       finish     endif   Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that   they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for   your setup. Basic explanation:   Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is   configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter   extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru   that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.   The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement   for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different   user, chgrp as appropriate.   It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I   haven't investigated that end. Notes:   This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA   has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),   and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If   you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for   other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so   don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if   you wish.   A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail   servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA   support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less   complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA   configuration. Caveat Emptor.     ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a   ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no   confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing   silent sidetracking of mail). --  J C Lawrence                 ---------(*)                Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas.  claw@kanga.nu               He lived as a devil, eh?		   http://www.kanga.nu/~claw/  Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users";1;0

(plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect).

Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it.
I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.

It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.

After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.

Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:

Which annoyance? A string like f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100

That doesn't matter.  What does matter
is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
example makes a good case for natural
selection, but not for artificial.

(do ""married people live longer"" because
of the benefits of matrimony, or because
acceptable health is one of the qualities
selected for in spouses?)

Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
or fewer biological great grandparents
(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
distinction seems much more relevant.

One can also view that argument as a case
for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if
caution is in order, they are some of the
least likely people to volunteer it.

That's clearly the same bug.

I don't think I can fix it either...I certainly can't while my copy of Brent's 
book is across town.  I do understand parts of tk fairly well, but the 
event handlers give me a headache.

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no longer marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.

[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book. [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.  Read the interview in full: http://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=2&id=808&tid026 Or read about Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook: http://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007302&tid026 ***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET. There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics. What is free threading?  Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.

What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book? [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a  large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code  to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers. [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are  not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a  great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book  is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book.

That's simple.  The same thing that any beta project needs to improve.
Continuous
End-User testing, constructive feedback, and suggestions on how to improve
the
system.  Upgrade each time a new beta version comes out, so everyone is
testing
on the same version of the code, and old bugs don't get reported as being in
the
new version, thus slowing down the debugging process.

Report any installation issues, bugs, errors, etc., to the V2 beta list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-testers) so that they can
be quickly
looked at, etc.  Provide detailed description of issues, include logs if
possible,
as well as any ""captured"" spam that generated the error(s).


Thank you, please drive through,

Include a random token with an expiration date with anything you send.

It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc  accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it. It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of  falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an  effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence. It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on  folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does  not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic  scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now  corresponds better to what's on disk. Comments appreciated. I'm going to be offlike for a couple of days,  so I send the cvs diff rather than putting it in the cvs. /Anders --==_Exmh_6514812010 Content-Type: application/x-patch ; name=""exmh.patch"" Content-Description: exmh.patch Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""exmh.patch"" Index: lib/ftoc.tcl =================================================================== RCS file: /cvsroot/exmh/exmh/lib/ftoc.tcl,v retrieving revision 1.29 diff -u -b -B -w -p -r1.29 ftoc.tcl --- lib/ftoc.tcl	22 Jul 2002 21:46:35 -0000	1.29 +++ lib/ftoc.tcl	24 Jul 2002 09:16:25 -0000 @@ -558,7 +558,7 @@ proc FtocPickRange { {addcurrent 0} } {  	if {$addcurrent} {  	    Ftoc_RangeHighlight $ftoc(curLine) $ftoc(curLine)  	} -	Ftoc_ClearCurrent +	Ftoc_ClearCurrent $ftoc(curLine)  	Msg_ClearCurrent  	set ftoc(curLine) {}      } @@ -611,31 +611,55 @@ proc Ftoc_NewFtoc {} {  # Ftoc_ClearCurrent and Ftoc_Change are two parts of  # dinking the ftoc display when advancing a message.   -proc Ftoc_ClearCurrent {} { -    # Clear display of current message +# +# Make line no longer appear as the currently selected line +# + +proc Ftoc_ClearCurrent { line } {      global ftoc exwin      set ftoc(pickone) 1      set ftoc(lineset) {}   -    if {$ftoc(curLine) == {}} { -	set ftoc(curLine) [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)] -    } -    if {$ftoc(curLine) != {}} { -	$exwin(ftext) tag remove cur $ftoc(curLine).0 $ftoc(curLine).end -	Ftoc_RescanLine $ftoc(curLine) -    } -    return $ftoc(curLine) -} -proc Ftoc_Change { line {show show} } { +#We dont need this any more since we work off the line  +#argument, not $ftoc(curLine) +#    if {$ftoc(curLine) == {}} { +#      set ftoc(curLine) [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)] +#    } +#    if {$ftoc(curLine) != {}} { +#      $exwin(ftext) tag remove cur $ftoc(curLine).0 $ftoc(curLine).end +#      Ftoc_RescanLine $ftoc(curLine) +#    } +     #should check that 0<$line => $f"" warn @@ -1113,7 +1192,7 @@ proc FtocCommit {tagname commitProc {cop  	    set ftoc(displayDirty) 1  	    Ftoc_ClearMsgCache  	    if {$msgid == $curid} { -		Ftoc_ClearCurrent +		Ftoc_ClearCurrent $ftoc(curLine)  		Msg_ClearCurrent  	    }  	    if {$L == $ftoc(curLine)} { Index: lib/msg.tcl =================================================================== RCS file: /cvsroot/exmh/exmh/lib/msg.tcl,v retrieving revision 1.21 diff -u -b -B -w -p -r1.21 msg.tcl --- lib/msg.tcl	22 Jul 2002 21:23:48 -0000	1.21 +++ lib/msg.tcl	24 Jul 2002 09:16:26 -0000 @@ -73,10 +73,20 @@ proc Msg_ShowUnseen { {show show} } {      return 0  }  proc Msg_ClearCurrent { } { -    global msg exmh +    global msg exmh ftoc +    # Are there cases where this is not true? +    if {$ftoc(folder) == $exmh(folder)} {  +        set prevline [Ftoc_FindMsg [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)]] +        if {$prevline == {}} { +            unset prevline +        } +    }      set msg(id) {}		;# Clear current message      set msg(dpy) {}		;# and currently displayed message      Mh_ClearCur $exmh(folder) +    if {[info exists prevline]} { +        Ftoc_ClearCurrent $prevline +    }      MsgClear      Buttons_Current 0      Uri_ClearCurrent @@ -117,13 +127,13 @@ proc Msg_Change {msgid {show show} } {      Exmh_Debug Msg_Change [time [list MsgChange $msgid $show]]  }  proc MsgChange {msgid {show show}} { -    global exmh exwin msg mhProfile +    global exmh exwin msg mhProfile ftoc   -    Ftoc_ClearCurrent +    set prevline [Ftoc_FindMsg [Mh_Cur $ftoc(folder)]]      Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid      Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)      set line [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid] -    if {!

2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606

July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET

       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.

       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""

       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.

       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""

       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""

Here, here... The member-only lists that I'm on have a spam count of 
near zero. An additional benefit is that the list archives aren't full 
of spam either.

I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed >> (especially those with multiple email addresses...). > > What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain. > Ah the great spam debate wages on ... So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-) Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )   Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down. When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even _better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to my @hotmail account. I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more knowledgable. My half a cent here... : I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :) Woo hoo!   Law school!)    http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork";1;0

They don't have to.  All they have to do is use some program (which, if
they don't exist already, will certainly be around someday soon) that makes
every spam they send show the recipient as the ""from"" address as well.

The adding manually thing doesn't seem like much fun.  And, anytime I speak
to someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to
contact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be
amazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to
ignore the ""please apply"" messages.

As an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the
addressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any
reason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to
send out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an
addressbook, and search out the last email I received from someone and hit
reply...

Well, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends
do.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I
know, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty
others have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of
them for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which
email addresses are already approved and avoid using others.

Plus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email
address from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new
job info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to
tell them about your new job email address?

If your using spamd and you want your users to have some control using
user_prefs then check their ~/spamassassin file.
If your using spamd and you have a site wide only policy then make sure that
spamd is started with the -x option.
If you used the -x option then the only place that it should get the rules from
would be from the local.cf in the /etc/mail/spamassassin directory. Assuming a

Of course was genetic engineering. It used the fundamental mechanism of 
genetics (inheritance of traits), and not randomly, but 
intentionally--breeding for long fur, fat hams, whatever. The degree to which 
the engineers--farmers, breeders--understood exactly how the mehcanism works 
is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering. 
Science progresses. Over the years, centuries, their, our, knowledge 
increased, and domestication became more effective. Bit by bit the mechanisms 
became known--Mendel making a major breakthrough. The first hybrid grains 
(which date from the 1920s) represent another step. Watson and Crick another, 
etc. But it's engineering--just as Roman architecture was civil engineering, 
even if they knew less about the mathematics behind it than we do today, just 
as Galen was a physician, though laughably ignorant by our standards.

Then individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys. It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then person B can check off that person on their list. The reverse is then done for person B. After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using your private key.

Better yet, start another list; fork-spam and forward the suspect items to it.
Much like the noarchive list.  This wouldn't be perfect but it'd be better than
nothing at all.

This should not impress you so much. At one time I even detected my name on that page and I contributed less than a handful of rather simple rules. That's not to say I don't appreciate Marc's contributions to the effort.

And maybe because there isn't an official 2.40 yet. It's 2.40-cvs and 
changes from day to day. Or, to cite the page [1]: ""these are built nightly 
from CVS. They may be unstable!"". One and a half good reason :o)

If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.                                                                                                                                                                     
The check_local tarball can be downloaded on
http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/beta.html

Another alternative solution is to use Mimedefang : it offers
anti-spam, attachment defanging, custom filtering.

Circa 50MB-100MB web space for now
POP email accounts 
Account Control Panel 
Perl 
PHP 
MySQL 
FTP and Telnet Access 24/7
Own CGI-BIN
Webalizer Graphical Stats 
Server Side Includes 
Good Reachable Technical Support

I have seen a great looking 300MB solution in the region of 600Euro p.a. which at the moment is a bit over my financial head in one payment - I haven't completed any sites yet, but have a few potential jobs coming up.

Any tips/pointers much appreciated!

Regards,
Elvin

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace that with.   There's obviously a way as the ""Sequences"" menu does this. The ""Mark Unseen"" menu entry in the message ""More"" menu is still wanting that function as well...   | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to   | display the other sequences. Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen, top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc... I have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall off the bottom, and not be shown). I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring, just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or other decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around and do I can see when new mail needs processing). I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to the ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current. This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message, it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is packed, sorted, etc). I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"". It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder happens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful (to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist, which can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is clumsy that way) Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ... syntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""     while executing ""expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))""     (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsg"" line 46)     invoked from within ""Ftoc_FindMsg $msg""     (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsgs"" line 5)     invoked from within ""Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids""     (procedure ""Ftoc_PickMsgs"" line 5)     invoked from within ""Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)""     (procedure ""PickInner"" line 13)     invoked from within ""PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}""     (""uplevel"" body line 1)     invoked from within ""uplevel #0 $cmd""     (procedure ""busyCursorInner"" line 8)     invoked from within ""busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets""     (procedure ""busyCursorHack"" line 32)     invoked from within ""busyCursorHack $args""     (""cursor"" arm line 1)     invoked from within ""switch $busy(style) { 	icon		{busyIcon $args} 	cursorAll	{busyCursor $args} 	cursor		{busyCursorHack $args} 	default		{eval $args}     }""     (procedure ""busy"" line 3)     invoked from within ""busy PickInner $cmd $msgs""     (procedure ""Pick_It"" line 51)     invoked from within ""Pick_It""     invoked from within "".pick.but.pick invoke""     (""uplevel"" body line 1)     invoked from within ""uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]""     (procedure ""tkButtonUp"" line 7)     invoked from within ""tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick ""     (command bound to event) It has been ages since I did this last though.

Doesn't defeat this system at all. If you see that once, feed it into 
your bayesian classifier, and it classifies the URLs used for the

that an email with one of those URLs is definitely spam.

In many ways this is like Razor, which is why I'm hacking on a 
distributed system to do this, to see if it's feasible to scale it globally.

The turnaround is distinct since P2P has distanced itself from the darling days of Napster and has been transplanted onto the architectural drawing boards of Internet and corporate network gurus. For network executives, the about-face is showing up in such discrete places as wireless routing, identity management, Web services and grid computing. P2P has proved its worth - albeit with a few warts - in enterprise collaboration and content management applications, but its brightest future may be in the plumbing of corporate distributed computing.   But even as P2P fades into the background, questions around security, standards and quality of service still have to be answered before P2P can flourish, experts say. The P2P evolution Regardless, P2P's evolution has hit its next stage.  ""Peer-to-peer is an architecture and one that will play a substantial role in distributed computing as endpoints in the network gain more power,"" says Jamie Lewis, CEO and research chair of Burton Group. He says that will be particularly important for Web services as peers share processes and data. ""P2P will become a fundamental part of how distributed computing evolves across the Internet and how enterprises build distributed systems internally.""  Lewis says the Internet today is very rudimentary with its basic protocols for basic operations. ""Now we're seriously talking about the network becoming the computer, incorporating some P2P connections and being able to share processes and power, which is what grid computing provides."" Observers say it's a renaissance. ""P2P's reverting to an architecture that can be applied to solve problems that by their very nature are distributed,"" says Neil Macehiter, senior consultant for Ovum, a research and consulting firm. ""But the question is can this model provide benefits for business use."" Macehiter says it can, but he cautions that security, such as removing blocks to P2P traffic on corporate firewalls, is still a major inhibitor to acceptance.  ""But you can imagine something like grid extending to share application logic instead of just being a data grid or a storage grid. When you look at Web services sharing business logic in the enterprise, you see the intersection with grid and P2P,"" he says. Working together To underscore P2P's evolution, the Global Grid Forum (GGF), a 2-year-old group founded by academics and researches, merged in April with the P2P Working Group, originally founded by Intel. The groups are attempting to marry the GGF's work on harnessing servers on a grid with P2P's ability to connect desktops. ""We're now trying to figure out how grid and P2P play nice together, and capture that power for use in enterprise computing,"" says Andrew Chien, co-director of the GGF's peer-to-peer area and CTO of Entropia, a provider of desktop grid applications. Late last month, the merged group began evaluating how P2P relates to the Open Grid Services Architecture, an effort to standardize grid computing. Chien says his group is exploring how P2P protocols for such things as registration, resource discovery and coordination of data transfer support a common grid infrastructure. And P2P's roots are reaching into other areas. It is an integral part of mobile wireless technology set for release this fall by MeshNetworks. The company's MeshLAN software extends the range of 802.11 wireless networks by making every wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc P2P network and also a router/repeater to channel traffic to other peers. Using a patented multihopping technology, peers that are out of range of wireless access points or peers they wish to communicate with can hop through other peers to reach their destination, including corporate LANs. It not only increases the wireless range, it preserves throughput, which is up to 6 megabits. The technology also is mobile, letting hopping take place from nodes traveling in vehicles up to 250 mph. ""P2P allows us to do the hopping, and our algorithms allow the traffic to pick the most efficient path to travel,"" says Rick Rotondo, vice president of disruptive technologies for MeshNetworks. ""The beauty of a P2P network is that it is self-forming and self-healing."" And the technology is mature.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which created the Internet, spent $150 million developing the peer technology for use in forming instant networks among soldiers on a battlefield. MeshNetworks licensed it from DARPA has spent an additional $27 million to create a commercial product. P2P also is key to the PingID Project to create an identity management system similar to work under way by Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance Project, which are not using P2P.  ""Ideally, you need a way to create, manage and exchange digital identity information with no one in the middle of the transaction,"" says Andre Duran, founder of the project. He says that's P2P, but it's just one part of the equation.  ""Your ID is a virtual private vault with different drawers,"" Duran says. ""One drawer may be on your PC, one may be with a service provider, and you need a client to manage all that. We are building the infrastructure to support that."" Ping ID is working on server and client software that acts like a mini-Web server and maintains a repository of user's identity information. Users have the option of exchanging IDs directly through P2P or using client/server technology to authorize a third party to dispense their identity data.  ""P2P provides a level of control that other architectures don't,"" Duran says. ""It comes down to the fact that some applications are more efficient with P2P."" That is the concept that is driving P2P into so many different areas of computing. ""P2P has evolved from something highly disruptive to something complementary to intranets, extranets, mobile users and all the Web integration,"" says Greg Bolcer, CTO of Endeavors Technology, which develops a P2P collaboration software called Magi. And although P2P is still settling into this new role, it's obvious that its reputation as a music-swapping corporate scourge are now well behind it. 					   Copyright 2001 Network World, Inc.

Without addressing the overpopulation argument, the more bureaucracy,
the more opportunity for corruption. If a corporation is corrupt,
there are generally, absent more government intervention,
alternatives. With bureacracy that is more difficult; one generally
most uproot oneself and move.

oops.  OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,
accordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as
the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.

cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b

So, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that
were not there before the branch:

  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too
    lax and caused FPs

  - Matt's faster HTML parser

  - commented rules un-commented again

  - a doco fix for spamd


and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:

  - the INSTALL file ;)

  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary

  - Added examples to -R docs
  
  - Added Habeas HIL lookup

  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.
    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com
    (Christopher Davis) applied.

  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,
     fixes bug 655

  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file
    with -u arg

  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine

  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been
    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST

  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D

  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request

  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output

  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users
    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger
    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on
    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.

  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance

  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0

  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code
    catch additional types of web bugs

  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid
    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer
    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move
    them to the compensation file))

  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html
    were triggering.

  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser

  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing
    any nonspam matches)

  - raise some negative scores that are way too low

  - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND
    and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much

  - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph

  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of
    different eval functions needed for HTML tests

Hi Tim,
It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.

(Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )

Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.

All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.

As for your initial question,

Mark.

Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen.

320;UW Email Robot <pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu>;fork <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>;Wed, 21 Aug 2002 16:20:17 -0700;The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14);"--------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is MIME?

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 

How can I read a MIME message?

Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)

In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 

There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 

Does MIME replace UUENCODE?

Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 

How can I learn more about MIME?

The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                       
     o  US East Coast                            
        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        
                                                        
     o  US West Coast                            
        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      
                                                        
     o  Pacific Rim                              
        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)

        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) 

Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt

Sure.  I described it the way I understand it to another person off 
list a little while ago.


It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.


LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)

The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular

exmh uses the profile setting - it appears as mhProfile(unseen-sequence)
in the code.

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
increase the speed a little bit.

If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.

Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

I call it spam if I ask to be removed from the spamming list though. 
I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.

future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
is big and has loads of room inside.
Oh... and it looks very cool :-)

However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says

* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
* ATX Power supply sold separately

In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
that show) but I missed that :-)

I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
(thanks Mike)

So now I can code-in-peace...

Try using a small crocodile-nosed pliers if you have enough space around
th head of the screw. If not, try a hacksaw blade on the shaft of the
screw under the board (taking care not to scratch the underside of the
board. after cutting the screw, that holder on the board support structure
cannot really be used again.

Another method is to get a small screwdriver that you can consider
disposable, and gently tap it into the head of the stripped screw, until
you either have a flat head screw, or you can get enough turning force
 on it.

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I am trying to do on my linux desktop what I used to do with some other os software.

I'm trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files. Eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp, analyse them and mail me the results.

As I'm no programmer (by any stretch of the imagination !) I'm getting a bit lost.

I can deal with single files (eventually) using grep, egrep, awk, and a nice perl script called 'total' which i found while googling.

Problem now is that the data I'm trying to report on is split between two isam files.

File 1 contains
Docket Number, Line Number, Item, quantity, price, duedate

File 2 contains
Docket Number, Customer, Shipping date, invoice number.

To make some sense of the data, I need to relate the Docket number between the 2 files, so that I can generate a report by customer.

My first reaction is to look at mysql, and import the ascii data into 2 tables so that I can use sql queries.

Is this the way to go, or should I delve a bit deeper into perl ?

Any advice welcome.

Quite interesting -- it's pretty similar to the spam phrases stuff.  As
Scott pointed out, this would work quite well as a naive Bayesian system.
(in fact, I think it may be quite close to being one already...)

I like the way ""FL"" -- ie. Florida -- is one of the top scoring terms. ;)

Also, when I was doing the spam-phrases stuff, I discounted the ff0000
thing, as HTML garbage! never realised it corresponded to ""bright red"" :(
Have we got a test for that?

Socialism increases regulation which increases corruption.  But that
doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
facts on the ground.

If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.

In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
people they care about.

In other cases, you originally had owners who didn't have the 'right' to

It is interesting to note that for several centuries in Japan it was a
death sentence to sell land.  They sold it anyway, and kept records.

In the US, we eventually got quite friendly with squatters and adverse
possession, and integrated out extra-legal arrangements and 'spontaneous
social contracts' into the official law.

Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

I agree.  In a way, I signed up just by buying steaks from them.  However, once
I tell them to stop, everything after that is spam.  I told them to stop *many*
times.

It's a pity, too, since they have great steaks.  Buying from them is just not
worth having to put up with all of that clinginess.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it 
stopped working.

Was it intended that if you added a sequence to the 'never show' list that
it not take effect till you stopped and restarted exmh?  I added 'pseq',
then hit 'save' for Preferences - didn't take effect till I restarted.

i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.

my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.

rgds,
rob

This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,
if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth
all day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced
that they will (stupid or not).

While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same
argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?

I don't buy it.

For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.

Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that ""changed the face of communications"".

I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.

I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but
it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.

What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.

I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.

The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.

Willing to be proven wrong,
Mike

PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec... probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough? The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/ More ideas are welcome.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files back into place and you're ready to go. That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my computers to work for example).

that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.

http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html

There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html

""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.

All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.

But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.

It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.

But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """;1;0

Look for ""Zygalski sheets"". By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had mock Enigmas which cycled through the Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a quarter of an hour, but the Germans started using a plugboard which then had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities.  The Poles noticed that there were some patterns in the messages which were only possible via certain plugboard settings, and so: > When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different > initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares > corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a > light beneath the pile.

So the brute force hardware allowed precalculation of ""optical"" computing devices which then narrowed down the possibilities enough for brute force to again be used for daily decodes, until: > On 10 May, the Germans invaded France and, on the same day, in > accordance with the best cryptographic principles, they changed their > Enigma procedures in such a way that the 1560 Zygalski sheets, each > with their carefully drilled 1000 or so holes, became just so much > waste cardboard. -Dave :::::: > > ""the first synthetic-aperture-radar processor was optical"" This is also easy to believe, given Dr. Elachi's description of the 1981 Shuttle Imaging Radar: > The received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved > after landing.

The bombes used for Enigma were electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified.

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness. 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.   http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn. 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/ What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"". Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own kernel. I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a kernel recompiled with ACPI.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument  against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that  they  a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some  sort of autodetection and changing crap) b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because  formats have changed. Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands  of you, the maintainer of the machine.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put  /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use  the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the  data as is. If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need  to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup  and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over  ssh.  It's the best way to make backups. > These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

If you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.   score RAZOR_CHECK 10 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient. If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient. Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA won't do it and avoid the double network hit. However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as Razor1.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for ""Named Objects"". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named   Objects"". - Current types of ""Named Objects"" include:     NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication  	Framework     AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using 	digital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain:  - Core: 	hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level 	NameSpaces  - Signing Services: 	Implementation of web based signing services 	End user hosted signing service  - Example User Authentication Application  - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks.

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:

If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.

If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

Anyone else with this problem?

Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is showing up, right? Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which, as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker: ""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...) But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um, lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in. I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing with them. :-). Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal. I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was just looking to make friends as I was new in town. The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a room... That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age, looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women. You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics - -- but I won't go there, I promise. If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

Here's hoping that tradition perseveres for the novelist
currently on trial in Paris for calling Islam ""the stupidest
religion""...

http://ca.news.yahoo.com/020917/5/ozxa.html

# Tuesday September 17 11:07 AM EST
#
# French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts
# By Caroline Brothers
#
# PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq
# faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
# by calling Islam ""the stupidest religion"" and its holy book the
# Koran a depressing read.
#
# The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause
# celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of
# expression against religious sensitivities.
#
# The Muslim groups, which include the Mecca-based World Islamic
# League and the Paris Mosque, accuse the writer of insulting Islam in
# an interview with the literary magazine ""Lire"" during last year's
# launch of his novel ""Plateforme.""
#
# Lire is also on trial over the remarks, which have taken on an added
# significance in France in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
# and concern about Islam following the September 11 attacks by Muslim
# radicals in the United States.
#
# Shortly after the trial started, 11 people in the courtroom stripped
# off their shirts to reveal T-shirts saying ""No to the censure of the
# imams"" and ""Marianne veiled, Marianne raped"" -- a reference to the
# female symbol of the French republic.
#
# ""Freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other
# Houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
# courtroom at the main law courts in central Paris.
#
# While intellectuals argued before the trial that Houellebecq should
# be free to write what he wants, Lyon Mosque rector Kamel Kabtan
# retorted: ""We are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting
# communities.""
#
# BETE NOIRE
#
# Houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary French literature,
# is no stranger to controversy. He offended conservatives and the
# politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""Les Particules
# Elementaires"" (""Atomised"" in English).
#
# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted
# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme
# admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""Palestinian
# terrorist"" was killed.
#
# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National
# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in
# bringing Houellebecq to trial.
#
# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying
# Houellebecq's comments amounted to ""Islamophobia"" and deserved to be
# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination
# and racism.
#
# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading
# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former
# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for
# sending Jews to death camps.
#
# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?
#
# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case
# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact
# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says
# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.
#
# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour
# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
# article before it appeared.
#
# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the
# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's
# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.
#
# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached
# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
# love.
#
# Translated into 25 languages, ""Atomised"" incensed France's 1968
# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the
# world's biggest fiction prizes.
#
# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.

This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday
to Lori!

One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got even
bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions came down
in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional Windows player is
MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my opinion. Sure, MusicMatch
is a decent player, but with plenty of great free players on the market, why
do we want to purchase a software player in addition to the $299+ hardware
unit?

At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true Windows
compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides
song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's XPlay remains a
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an iPod with
almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with contact management,
via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the iPod an additional drive on your
PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off
Apple's officially endorsed player.

Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of
winferno.com, although I'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the
free copy of Research-Desk for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival,
I enjoyed dinner with the eSellerate gang, with a discussion about GnomeTomes
and what the future holds.

Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately,
my Crosspaths.net connection allows me to send mail via my Lockergnome
account, unlike most of the national dialup services. Crosspaths is
technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of presence in almost every
major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, you may want to take a
look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori has used their DSL
service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of outstanding in
dealing with customer service queries.

getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail price tag. The
mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. The only thing I find odd
about this site is their proclamation of paying artists 50% of distribution
profits, which I have to assume is 50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The
artist selection contains some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

**Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?** (NR) 1966  
Adapted Play - 131min  
Reviewer's Tilt (10)

![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)![](http://images.lockergnome.com/images/dvdgnomefull.gif)

Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen
debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of
Virginia Woolf?"" Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards,
this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his
wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president. At first
George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-
adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. George
and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty
cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. Just as
quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology
professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy
Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic
exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. Soon Nick and Honey find
themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.
Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely
choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead,
alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.
Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost
unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and
impeccable timing. At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with
Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how
about a little round of Get the Guests?"" This provides some idea of the
precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to
finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is
Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold. Ok,
I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not
have been much of a stretch. Both actors, however, deliver their lines with
the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying
slaying. Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax
or look away. Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is
not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a
memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

**Greetings from Download.com!**

No software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code will have to
go through a debugging process, but some debuggers are more efficient than
others. Check out Download.com's complete collection of debugging tools here,
and put away the can of Raid.

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First, there's Chilkat, a
cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can add to any language with ActiveX
support (which is most major ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap,
a simple tool that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual
Basic masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file for ease of
distribution.

in ActiveX  
**Chilkat Zip 6.0.2**  
Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and decompress zip archives
with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX control. The control provides easy access to
individual files stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual files or files
matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to any directory, and the control's
memory management allows any size file to be compressed or decompressed in a
constant memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly from
memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files with wildcarding.
There's even a real-time progress monitor for zip and unzip operations.
Chilkat supports Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++
Builder, and all languages that use ActiveX controls.

in Java  
**Anfy Java 2.0**  
Anfy is a collection of 52 applets for Web pages, desktop wallpapers, or
screensavers. Within the program's simple interface, you can quickly apply
real-time graphic effects to GIF and JPEG images. Effects include 3D texture-
mapped cube menus, lake effects, water and fire, deformations, zoom rotators,
lens magnification, waving flags, animations, scrolling text, customizable IFS
fractals, color changers, light shading, tunnels, and wormholes.

in Tools & Editors  
**VB-PowerWrap 3.1**  
Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with VB-PowerWrap. VB-
PowerWrap embeds all dependent and non-dependent files into the executable of
your VB program, including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans a VB project,
wraps the appropriate files, and creates a self-contained file for
distribution. In addition, VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and
registers appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It works with
Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.

CNET Software and Internet Services |   |  **Dear Readers,**  
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier worms. If you
update your antivirus software on a regular basis, these new versions of
Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance. But if you haven't updated in a
while, these variants--plus the continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate
you. In security news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could
affect Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.

**Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password**  
An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with a password
is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k,
technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also called Frethem.l by some vendors,
uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected
systems. This worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.

**Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading**  
The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly screensaver, proving
that users worldwide are still opening attached files from total strangers.
Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a
successful variant of a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year.
Thankfully, this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.

**Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in**  
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client,
inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail program open to attack.
Fortunately, there is a patch available.

**Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news**  
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its
upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.

Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating
earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year.
CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the
tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to
1,397.23.

With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings
estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent,
to 8,542.48. The S&P; 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.

**Motorola Sees Profit Rebound**  
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects
to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by
aggressive cost cutting. Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly
loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a
share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated
earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215
million related to previously announced restructuring actions. The world's
second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a
third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut
another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.  
**MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%**

**Apple meets lowered expectations**  
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched
analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools
fell short of the company's initial hopes. The company earned $32 million, or
9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year
ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48
billion Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share,
according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the
range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6
billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents
per share.  
**APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%**

**HP, EMC storage systems to work better together**  
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they
were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage
systems work better together. However, the deal will not include technology
from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage
system, an HP spokesman said. The deal follows close cooperation between
storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in
May.  
**HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 13.57 -4.84%**

**Investec Inc. stays bullish on Intel in report 7/17/02**  
Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a ""strong buy"" rating on the
computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the
consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal
increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer
laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the
stock is a bargain.

**Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMac**  
NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's
switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio
players and a new flat-panel iMac. Jobs used his keynote speech at the
Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such
as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of
free iTools. The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players
include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows
operating system.

**Scient files for Chapter 11**  
Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed
to sell certain assets to a professional services firm. The deal calls for
Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up
to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.
Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the
company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. The company and SBI
said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that
financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients
without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

**Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth**  
What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha? That's what users of the company's
free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the
word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes
to ""espresso."" To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated
filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code
known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web
enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the
recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as
telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change
a password, for example.

Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the
software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion, which runs through
Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and
upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version
of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable
software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X
and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or
server.

**New chip may portend ATI comeback**  
ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week
with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms
of performance. The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the
details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new
architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images,
according to sources. The fastest versions of the new chips will offer
considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving
ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after
Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--
comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two
will remain close.

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, Iowa has a bridge
that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such a structure, or
just want to have the right to say you legitimately purchased the Brooklyn
Bridge, here's your opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!

Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had a cup-o-java with
Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving coffee. I can't see myself turning into a
coffee junkie like Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited to the severe need
for a quick morning wake-up or in an effort to keep warm on cold mornings when
out in the field back in my Marine Corps days.

As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the typical geek vices of
sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and
what's the point of drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, Iowa. Most of what
Diana and I use sugar for has been modified to use Splenda instead, with good
results. Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it usually
is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from the nasty breath. It's
fun to test out the dragon-breath on the cat to see just how bad it really is.
If Bootes sniffs a couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of minutes. See what you've
started, Jake?

See You in August,  
Randy Nieland

**Exchange Titanium Details Emerge**

http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp

Oracle recently announced their intention to compete directly with Microsoft
Exchange, even accepting Outlook as an email client. In what seems like a
direct response, we're handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange
Titanium. I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly looking
forward to seeing what the new features will be all about, but I'm also
interested in what Oracle will be bringing to the table. Better email
functionality, control and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up
being the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A; is a screenshot of what
Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. It's an interesting concept
shot, showing some new ways they plan to handle email views. It doesn't say
anything for Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

**Better Pocket PC Audio**  
Unearthed by David Spencer

http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html

An open source project is bringing a different spin to audio and video on
Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... cool! I like what they're working on
here. I decided to wipe out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio quality using this
player, which has an equalizer built-in, but it definitely has potential
judging from how it sounds on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give
this a peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and video on a
Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are supported, so you should be able
to find something appropriate to your device.

**Where's Java?**

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html

Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, and it's something you
should probably know about if you use Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the
Java Virtual Machine with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has
been avaialble via the Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part
of Sun's legal complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that
Microsoft did not have the right to distribute their implementation via the
web, though they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. So
essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. Well, to avoid
further web distribution arguments, Microsoft has yanked the JVM from the
Windows Update site and all other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is
still planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. You'll have to
plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is still a ways off and you can't
get it from Microsoft at this point. If you need it for a new installation of
Windows XP in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their own
distibution.

**Another Xeon Deal**  
Served up by Warren Dugas

http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-
details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P

I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual- Xeon workstations a
few weeks back, which I know several of you took advantage of, but the $1999
price tag likely scared off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon,
check this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 workstation with a
single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses
for both Windows 2000 Pro and NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there
is NO memory and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. Also realize that
these systems take RAMBUS memory, which will add a bit of cost, so be sure you
know what you're getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure!
Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.

Recommend It!

**Slowing sales shrinking Intel workforce**  
Intel announced lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and that **4,000 jobs**
(5 percent of its staff) would be eliminated this year. This may bring Intel's

**Software contracts: Clause for alarm**  
In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued
sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's the **language in the
contracts**. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over
the fine print of multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with
obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and **mind-boggling license
conversions**. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined
long after the deal is signed. Just ask California.

**Rack server a la mode**  
With its Xserve rack-mount server, **Apple is moving into enterprise
territory**. The specs are impressive: Dual 1GHz PowerPC G4s, up to 2GB DDR
SDRAM, two 64-bit 66MHz PCI slots (plus a third combination PCI/AGP slot),
dual Gigabit Ethernet, FireWire and USB ports, and four Ultra ATA/100 Apple
Drive Module bays. But **Bill O'Brien** thinks Apple's **licensing** may be
even more appealing than the hardware.

\--Tom Dunlap  
Senior editor  
CNET Hardware  
|  |  **Dear Readers,**  
One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors, not mobile
CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around for a while, but the
bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these efforts. (Intel was never too crazy
about the idea, either.) Now, it's a bona fide movement, and the latest
9.6-pound desktop- replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new
heights. But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these things
really get so hot that you can press pants with them? Executive Editor John
Morris sorts it out for you.

**Rhapsody rules**  
I never thought Id say it, but Im changing my tune about subscription music
services.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late
last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software
was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I
wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of
file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.coms Rhapsody, a
subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure
recordings from all five major labels. And now Im rethinking my stance.

Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download
them to a portable player, youll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD
burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge,
and you cant download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and
lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons
of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something
with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that
has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download
MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

**Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who
should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:**

_""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest
possible usage by their target audience""_

A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.

_""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So
it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""_

After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this
response makes the best argument.

_""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to
only one browser.""_

Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall
into the Web user category.

_""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no
matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""_

Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while
noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.

_""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is
understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the
remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""_

A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost
efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share
browser.

Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I start
with the basics, for that reason, I'm going to take things step-by-step,
following my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult
concepts. Despite having experience in programming, using a variety of
languages, I initially found AppleScript to be quite intimidating -- mostly
because something about the Script Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've
already been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will
definitely be targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance
to get up to speed.

I'm off to the Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week,
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there
is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing out on the
Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while I'm in
the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at other Mac sites
when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is being provided by
Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services I've found that can be
configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I can still function on the
road. I tested the service on my iBook this evening just to be sure.

With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via my
Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis.
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't use
the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A landline
will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some updates on the
trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as
usual.

See You in August,  
Jake Ludington

**Same-X v2.0 [1.73MB] OSX 10.1.1 FREE**

http://www.thumpbunny.com/

Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes this
a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to clear the
board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two or greater at a
time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring awards clearing of
larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no swearing, but you'll find
yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- not to mention you can feel
safe sharing this with kids.

**Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE**

http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/

It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, for
small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this is the only
real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost painless, making it
easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your Mac with little difficulty.
The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is quite easy to navigate, including
user management, connection management, and share configuration into a
convenient Prefernce pane.

  

 GnomeSCRIPT  
  
---  
  
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text
editing application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in
the Script Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is
located in the AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the
application for the first time reveals a small window divided in to two
sections, Description and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of
buttons.

Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later
what it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will
invoke your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable
application, the information in the description will show up in the start up
screen.

The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for
scripting is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level
drilling down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to
manipulate with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating
things from the bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its
""Jake"" subfolder to tell the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in
that folder to do something could also be written by telling the script to
access ""Jake's Media Player"" located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the
""Applications folder, The upcoming example will make this a bit more clear.

**Glitschka.com**

http://www.glitschka.com

Flash animations, downloadable icons, artistic doodles, and details about the
artist himself are available from this site. You're guaranteed to find
something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, Von Robert
Glitschka might even take you on as a client. The portfolio is extensive,
including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old
daughter. A must read is the anatomy of an illustration section, which lays
down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a funny
creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is accessible
by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions.

  

 GnomeTIP

Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay
organized. For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on
the desktop, OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their
place. Open the Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes
under Show these items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons
to clutter the desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing
at all.

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda happened
with yesterday's tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label is
""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger, eh? The oversight
was totally my fault. I've been thinking about asking Gretchen and Brian to
help with future reviews. Don't be surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure
you'd welcome a female perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our
landlords pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the Internet? You
betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and rugs. I have a feeling I'll
be the one tweaking furniture layout. Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet.
I wonder if Ikea has an affiliate program?

I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but did you know
that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If you send an HTML message
to someone who has a yahoo.com account, something may get lost in the
translation. Try sending this sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression
to evaluate."" Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results
will surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit Marion
Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda funny, in a weird
sort of way. Not that I would want anything I send changed in any way, shape,
or form. It begs the question: what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give
them a bit, and they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's
throw away.

I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is this crazy
business with the broadband metering? What they advertise doesn't seem to be
what you get. Now that I'm forking out $60 per month for a supposed metered
rate of 640 down / 320 up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not
sure what I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure if
I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me out here? I'm
feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig is full? That is what
they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT I was paying for. I want
consistent speed - is this too much to ask?"" It's not too much to ask the
question, but it's probably too much to get the answer. I'm facing the same
dilemma right now, even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my
area. Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches on.
Watch those EULAs, folks.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

**Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://freeware.prv.pl/

{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those
games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two
pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When
I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my
computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does
Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also
let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who
want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and
uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows
the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it
easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.

  
**Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE**

http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm

{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run
into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an
""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow
encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this
handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same
technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web
Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning,
or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I
will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...

**SQLView v2.1.0.20 [5.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

{View ODBC Output} SQLView is ""A SQL Database viewing utility. (It)
automatically detects all available ODBC data sources and displays them in an
explorer-like tree. User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the
databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV

creation) displayed perfectly in SQL View. (And I have the .csv file to prove

**CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20**  
Unearthed by Shawn Verrall

http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp

{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The
Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar,
and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to
be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's
best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar
contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you
can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own
creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to
determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an
added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the
program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to
remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the
first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the
mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows
Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and
there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If
you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to
do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and
you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu
isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here...
just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it
belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use
that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

There are no plans for releasing details about TeS. Before the
release of Razor2, I'd pointed out that Razor2 backend (specially
TeS) will be closed.

cheers,

01. Secure IE
02. Disk cleanup on XP
03. Thanks but no thanks
04. Mouseless way home
05. Kartoo
06. XP time feature
07. Leaf Peeper Alert
08. Saving scraps
09. Quick access
10. Don't believe your email

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has 
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks 
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize 
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up 
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky 
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server 
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe 
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.

10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and 
that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
Outlook Express.

WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium 
issue, including:

*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system 
more secure.

*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.

*  Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free - 
and at no cost?

*  An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, 
and other info.

*  A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion 
feature.

*  A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.

*  Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your 
computer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your 
computer's power source.

*  Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important 
passwords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.

And more!  If you haven't subscribed yet, you won't find a better source of 
useful information for just 42 cents per issue.  That's $10 for a year's 
worth - 24 issues - at the NNT Store, http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store .

I'm not sure that I follow your reasoning here. Razor isn't your mail 
server. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. 
Nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their 
mail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, 
not when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, 
it means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some 
people may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because 
they don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be 
sleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean 
that at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. 
Knowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are 
constantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over 
10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people 
already recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database 
before you would get your 1000 votes.

Also, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for 
only one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 
sleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value 
99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.
In RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the 
thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.

Also, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree 
on whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 
reports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) 
mail.

You mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. 
First, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the 
legitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the 
more people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see 
the mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read 
time, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, 
re-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.

So I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.

	Jehan

And those would be????

Is there a point that you plan on releasing detailed information about
TeS, so we can stop engaging in idle speculation?

It's not my desire to second-guess you Vipul(however much my missives may
appear otherwise) or question the hard work you and the other
developers have put into the system, however it seems that every request
for such information has been met with silence.

Thanks.

But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to ""vote"" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no ""no"" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a ""yes"" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 ""yes"" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.

The system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.

As far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.

So ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?

Because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree. A
simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
factor in report times.

Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches
something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
filtering?

No, it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion
than the 1000 people who have submitted it as spam. Rather the 1000 people
who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is
something that would have to be determined in the context of the
individual message.

It's my opinion that it's not my job to unsubscribe to any list that I
haven't subscribed to, nor is it necessarily in my best interest given
that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the
unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid

Perlman"" ,    i3e-off@cse.ucsc.edu, slug-web@sluglug.ucsc.edu Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening To all, I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake. Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members. I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.   One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter to Hobbyists.   The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement, but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a vegetarian.   I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.   I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine.  However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy. One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of preserving the educational/institutional market. Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish.  It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS. I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested persons to legally view it. I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone. Sincerely, J.T.S.

It doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of ""files for xmame"" ;-) Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set here in Spain...).

Maybe you'll need to ""override"" other paths when doing the ""make"". Second, the ""%makeinstall"" macro automatically overrides many common values like ""prefix="" or ""datadir="", so it's completely redundant with the ""PREFIX="" you're passing to it. Take a look at the ""Makefile"" you have at that point to see how the ""install"" target is, and what it uses.

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave  the commission its latest layoff numbers. IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected.  An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected  taking voluntary layoffs.  Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize"" last quarter, too? IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees  from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh.  OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once.

Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle  up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin.  It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first  half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost.  Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper.  Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean. The working title?

It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers. IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected taking voluntary layoffs.  Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize"" last quarter, too? IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh.  OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.

WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET 5. SITE STATISTICS 0. INTRO Hello SourceForge.net Users, This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you. These databases manage everything from user authentication, session management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database- dependent website. Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2, a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and 70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the press release here: http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much difference other then the site will continue to grow and the SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of the databases advanced capabilities. Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months. If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site, please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always appreciate the feedback. Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the Open Source Community. Pat- Patrick McGovern Director, SourceForge.net 1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source community can always obtain the software released by hosted projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world, as to provide better download times regardless of which network provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location. Three new download servers have recently been added to our network, further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest additions include servers hosted by: Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA); http://www.twtelecom.com/ University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA) http://www.umn.edu/ CESNET (Czech Republic) http://www.cesnet.cz/ We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and the needs of the Open Source community. On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net 2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX Kernel Summit, held in June.

So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
around?]

I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
""production"" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.

When are we going to have a pint? 

CW

--------------------------
 I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.

 However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?

I suppose that means instead of: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         raid-disk       1 >  >         failed-disk     1  I should have had: > raiddev /dev/md0 >         raid-level      1 >         nr-raid-disks   2 >         nr-spare-disks  0 >         chunk-size     4 >         persistent-superblock 1 >         device          /dev/hdg3 >         raid-disk       0 >         device          /dev/hda5 >         failed-disk     1  It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive after the raid-disk one :)  Anyway.

Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it to load the initrd ?

While security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces
of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they
have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as
far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or
alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the
functionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts
both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from
these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what
the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content
control itself really means.

The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not
whether they may interfere with the power of the universal
logic device, or whether they are effectual from the
standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these
are all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental
problem they present is in the political premises that they
hope to implement for the sake of the ""content industries.""

TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the
concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May
20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The
WPPT declares an unprecedented ""moral right"" of authors to
control public uses of their works.

*That's* the real game plan.

TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the
masses.  They constitute an effort to ""democratize"" content
control under the concept of ""moral rights,"" encouraging the
public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised
by the specter of content control, and to confuse these
issues with private interest issues such as privacy and
security.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on
the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's
really on the line.

In America, we have never supported the concept of ""moral
rights"" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution
accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive
rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting
the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the
purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though
that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights
statutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court
explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good
reason.  In America, we implicitly understand the
distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which
copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make
up a work, to which it does *not* apply.

The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must
be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:
information is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it
*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,
however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes
to ""universal content control"" for the sake of so-called
""moral rights"" implemented at the behest of narrow content
industry interests.

TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage
the general public, and more specifically producers of
information products in general, to identify content control
with ""moral rights,"" blithely overlooking the real
implications of information technology in a free society,
and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding
the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the
prospects of information technology crucially depend.

	I've been thinking about this sort of thing
	lately, and how the technological realization
	of these issues is one that enforces *absolute*
	control of content, where the original legal
	strictures (copyright) only enforced a limited
	time limited right to content.

	What I'm wondering is this:  if you give
	people absolute control of copyright, whose
	works will be around in 100 years?  Because
	I'm starting to think that the content
	creator who wants to produce for posterity
	had better do it in such a way that the
	content is *not* ""protected"", or the content
	will be inaccessible to people in 15 years,
	much less 100.

	This of course assumes that the content
	control mechanisms aren't so pervasive that
	one *cannot* create content without going
	through controlled channels.

Well, SpamAssassin will just ignore any old X-Spam-whatever headers

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

Good to hear it's not just me.  Mind telling me how you set PERL5LIB
specificly? I've tried a few things (setenv in the shell, as well as
$PERL5LIB == ...inside the Makefile.PL, even on the perl command

Dear Garrison,

There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?

Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New Jersey

I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.";1;0

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software

Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.

Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.

In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.

Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.

On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).

Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest

San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.

Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.

In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!

Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.

Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.

The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans

Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.

When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm

Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

What the WSJ said, appended below. The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good"" of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *Commerce*. If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called ""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide. If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear. In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center. Cheers, RAH - ------- http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 11, 2002 REVIEW & OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273 fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2 =09az -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- --  ----------------- R.

September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.



September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.

This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.

Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.

The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.

Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.

America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.

The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.

Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.

Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists.

No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.

All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.";1;0

Maxtor Driving Capacity-Centric Enterprise Apps With ""Super-Sized"" ATA Drives

Maxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New 
Category of High-Density ATA Drives

MILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-

Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.

The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
recovered on demand.

These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
traditional ATA and SCSI drives.

For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
environments.

""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
enterprise applications.""

The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
three-year warranty.

The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
environments and enterprise applications.

With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.

""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""

Availability
Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.

dealing-with-SPAM issue.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That
pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""

But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access
DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.

That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
exmh working on the same set of folders.

It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
so bad that I can't stand it.

So you have 4 copies (1+1 per desktop) of exmh running?

That's what I usually do, but what I'd really like would be some 
 automagism to tell them ""Flist"", ""Rescan Folder"", which I now do 
 manually whenever I'm going to work at the ""other"" machine.

One of the nicer aspects of exmh's colour handling is that while I have the default background for the message pane set to black, the second insance of exmh displaying to a given $DISPLAY will set the background of the message pane to darkslategray.  Very nice as it provides an instant visual cue as to which is which.

**Greetings from Download.com!**

If you're developing Windows applications in an ActiveX-compatible environment
(which includes most major ones such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you
started taking advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com every day. This
week, we've collected the top programs that handle transparent GIF files,
offer prebuilt ActiveX controls, and edit hex code to get you up and running.

Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries: FileSystem 1.2
and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access to drives, folders, and I/O
operations; and AppSecureX adds serial number and shareware-type functionality
to your applications.

![Picks of the week](http://www.cnet.com/i/nl/dl/sub_picks.gif)  
![](http://www.cnet.com/i/nl/rule.gif)  
in ActiveX  
**FileSystem 1.2**  
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The FileSystem ActiveX
control offers complete access to common file information under Windows
through three independent interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access
to file I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code. Use this
control's interfaces to detect media types and media insertion, get complete
lists of folders and files at unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes
are set on files, and even load logbook files into collections automatically.
Rope in your files.

**ApSecureX 2.9**  
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX. This control
provides a registration system that produces a valid serial number customized
to the user's machine. When the user installs your software, a unique ID
number is generated for that system. To get the serial number, the user must
provide you with his installation number. The data file created by the
application is encrypted differently for each system, so even if someone were
to crack the file, they couldn't use the information on another machine.
AppSecure can also give your software shareware functionality such as number
of days left, checking to see if the system clock is set back, and so on.
AppSecureX works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo application is
included. Lock up your software.

in Java  
**AppletFile 2.5**  
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your Web site's file
upload and download capabilities. In addition to support for SSL, proxy, and
authenticated uploading, users can upload and download multiple files using
predefined paths to automate the process as much as possible. A scripting
language provides for sophisticated customization, and the user interface
includes support for 12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC feature downloads only
updated files, and verification of file transfer integrity is made possible
with built-in support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on HTTP
protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds Sun's Java Plug-in
support for Netscape 6+ browsers and shows removable media drives in the
browse dialog. Beam up your files.

in Tools & Editors  
**PHP Master Editor 2.0**  
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this tool. PHP Master
Editor includes an internal browser for viewing, as well as a debugger for
local testing. Basic FTP capability is also included. Specifically designed
for PHP programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions, variables,
and classes within the code, and features customizable code templates. Get
code-happy.

**Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news**  
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the
U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower
Wednesday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan
began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a ""buy"" rating, CNET's Tech index fell
26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.

Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled
pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points,
or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P; 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52
percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.

**AT&T;, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal **  
Shareholders of AT&T; Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the
planned $27 billion merger of AT&T; Broadband with Comcast, which will create
the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.
Telephone giant AT&T; in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to
Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a
one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.  
 **AT &T; CORP 9.78 -2.30% **

**$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down**  
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it
has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the
market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's
plans. Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the
past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to
outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco
Systems.  
 **CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82%**

**WorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny**  
The accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to
scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal
contracts. The Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to
take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year,
$3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as
soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which
supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control
systems.  
 **WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.20 -3.81%**

**Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes
7/10/02**  
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the
persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in
revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses
from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's
second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative
strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or
restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He
reiterates a ""buy"" rating on IBM.

**The tech side of homeland defense**  
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President
Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security, as politicians fret
about tech-savvy terrorists--and insist that any new agency must shield the
United States from electronic attacks. Meanwhile, the administration says that
it's open to the idea of a chief privacy officer for the agency.

upgrade to a 17-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) comes as sales have all but
stalled on existing 15-inch flat-panel iMacs. Apple unveiled the original
flat-panel iMac, which suspends the monitor from a pivoting arm attached to a
hemispherical base, during January's Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

**NextCard cuts off credit card customers**  
Federal regulators on Wednesday deactivated hundreds of thousands of credit
cards belonging to former customers of NextCard. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), which had been trying unsuccessfully to sell the 800,000
accounts since taking them over in February, shut them down after they failed
certain performance measures over the past three months, said David Barr, an
FDIC spokesman. Although NextCard customers will no longer be able to use
their cards to make purchase or cash withdrawals, they will continue to be
responsible for their outstanding balances.

When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to
understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to
indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs,
but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance.
I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the
operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications
(which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that
much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional
Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-
powered PDA.

(those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of
blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way
you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share
pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that
are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that
THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.

I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 Mac OS X Tips is in publication and
available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written
that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be
ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them
useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list
has improved my personal OS X experience.

Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections
of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the
other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it
just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me
links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in
upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to
eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom of each article. Unless
otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an
e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as
putting your message in front of Chris and Randy.

I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and
believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add
a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level
of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really
basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either
way, I'm open to some AppleScript suggestions.

See You in August,

**Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE**

http://www.searchstandard.com/

While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning off
some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the preferences
will speed things up considerably, particularly for local machine searches.
This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on search capabilities to the
bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of SearchStandard.com. This bundled
collection of search plug-ins makes it possible to look for almost anything
using Sherlock. Their Web site won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free
plugins most certainly make finding things online, including searches on your
favorite Mac sites, that much easier.

**Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48**

http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html

Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like intranet
access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those services failing from
time to time. Don't be left in the dark when one of your services go down, let
Xnet keep you informed. The unregistered version of the product lets you
verify http, ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your local machine,
verifying remote service availability and sending you a message when those
services go down. The interface allows for user-defined services, with alert
features for both an e-mail account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone)
and locally via a sound from your machine.

For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you need to
change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly useful in
situations where one user created a file, but an entirely different user is
the only one who will ever make future decisions relating to that file, like
whether to keep it or throw it in the Trash. chown is the Terminal command
designed to handle this. From the command line type:

sudo chown username filename

You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will replace
filename.

**50 LINUX TIPS:** From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two more eBooks
in the GnomeTome series. Whether you are a Linux newbie or command line guru,
you'll want these tips as part of your information arsenal. Get your copy of

As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it remains
important to understand where things evolved from. Susan Kare designed all the
original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 1983\. In fact, that smiling Mac
that appears as OS X boots is her creation. Check out her collection of UI
artwork, from both Windows and Mac operating systems. Also available from
Kare.com are Kare designed icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed
by Susan.

Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of the best
features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" related to a file or
application. This can be a great place to store information on recently made
changes to a file, information from others who've looked at a file, or in the
case of applications, serial numbers and other pertinent data you may need
when dealing with tech support.

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience:

""You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you might want to point
out to other Gnomies that they could practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for more than 1100 songs
available on the site and by downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is
provided) they can even change the key of the song to suit their voice range
as well as speed up or slow down the music to their taste. In other words, to
have the same experience as they would have with professional Karaoke
equipment but at no extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly prepared for your
Karaoke.""

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to help out a former
co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server and networking stuff. The tough
part is remembering everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always,
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks in advance and
I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a handprint on my forehead when I come
to the realization that I left something important behind. What will it be
this time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

See You in August,

**Forwarding to Internet Address Fails**

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636

Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all internal and Internet
email to his AOL mailbox when he's out of the office, and I figure it's going
to be a piece of cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was the driving force
behind this request. What I found was that Internet email proved to be easy
using a simple forwarding rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was
being sent out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to be
included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a default configuration
option on the Exchange 5.5 server that prevents automatic replies/forwards
from being sent to the Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A
quick configuration change and restart of IMS will put things right.

**Stop the Presses**

... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to the greater good and
delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly
disappointing, but I applaud the move. Instead of trying to downplay the
previously identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the service
pack will be put on ice until the issues are straightened out. Here's a quote
for you... Good job, Microsoft.

**Windows XP System File Checker**

Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a possible solution to my
Windows Media Player problem under Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it
prior to attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no improvement. It's
still worth a mention, however, in case you're not familiar with what it's
there for. As you're probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or altered in any
way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable state. Sometimes this system can get
a little out of whack, and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left in place since they
properly update the DLL Cache that is used as the sanity check to determine if
a system file has been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command
prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options.

**Consider This**  
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html

The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected representatives, you
might want to start asking about their opinions on technology laws that are
being proposed left and right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing
brain death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz Hollings
and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman gets his way, companies
may very well be allowed to hack into your systems without proof of
provocation in order to ensure that you are using their software according to
the stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or upset other
systems, there isn't thing one you can do in return. Nope, they'll have legal
protection. This garbage is seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be
abused, consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly pointed out
eBook security problems with Adobe's software and was promptly thrown in jail
for his trouble under the authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He
was eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more right.

Recommend It!

**Toshiba releases monster notebook**  
Weighing in at 9.6 pounds, the new **Toshiba Satellite 1955-S801** notebook
has a 2.2GHz Pentium 4 desktop processor and a huge 16-inch display. The
**desktop-replacement notebook** category also includes the Satellite 1905
that Toshiba introduced last month, as well as products from Hewlett-Packard.
Gateway and Dell may be looking at the concept too. The Satellite 1955 will
cost $2,499 and sports a few features not found in other desktop-replacement
notebooks, including a detachable wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.

**Tech gets set for China breakthrough**  
It's one of the few words that can perk up a high-technology executive these
days: China. Companies have attempted to tap the country's **enormous
potential** for years, but it has become a far more attractive target recently
as the rest of the world remains mired in **economic problems**. Now, the
People's Republic of China has become one of the leading strategic
opportunities for Intel, Nokia, Hewlett-Packard and virtually every other
multinational.

the primary role of TabletPC: Vertical applications? A notebook/desktop
replacement? Home use? Or will it meet the same fate as previous tablet

**Browse or bust**  
Through daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet
Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers.
But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a
messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last
couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in
their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.

I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem.
Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site
do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only
things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser
scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders
have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to
view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the
kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both
worlds.

Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web
builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.

** Is your ISP safe from hack attacks? **  
Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought long and hard about security
issues, but should you count on them to ward off intruders? Not wise, says our
ISP expert. In this week's column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his
own hands and shows you how to protect yourself.  
  
  
** Two apps that bring the iPod to the PC **  
That's right, Windows users. If you've been drooling over Apple's lovely
little MP3 player, you're in luck. Not one but two software apps bring iPod
compatibility to your FireWire-equipped PC. EphPod and XPlay square off in
this battle of cross-platform compatibility.

**Last week I asked whether Audiogalaxy could survive only offering non-
infringing files. Here are a few of your answers:**

_""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""_

Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.

_""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""_

But some people always find a silver lining.

_""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly
drivers, fixes, and patches.""_

A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.

_""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include
songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday
card and a bottle of wine.""_

I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.

_""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a
fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download
sites like Audiogalaxy.""_

With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record
companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it
work.

Last week, Axialis Software released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most
powerful icon editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict,
I asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one. Perhaps
you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a nice little contest
involving some of the most powerful sites on the Internet? Here's the deal:
you create five (or more) icons between now and the end of July 2002, upload
them to your [FREE] DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon
Contest), and one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from DeviantArt, KarmaGirl from WinCustomize, Voodoo from Neowin, and
Marc from Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not only
receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some of their icons
will get bundled with a future version of the software! Ownership is retained
by the original author, so don't hold back. Here's your chance at fame and
fortune. Or, at least fame and free software.

Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new (unofficial)
Google SearchTool today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar
(sorry, I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave Cacheman another go; I
haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a great piece of shareware,
but I didn't realize it was THIS good. The speed increase has been quite
noticeable (even on Storm Shadow, my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is
brilliant. And so is Repligator 9.0. It gives me access to instant special
effects - a one-stop shop for digital photo fun. I'm still debating whether or
not to install the latest Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test
machine, which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just wanna
run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and ""12 Mistakes Executives Make When
Planning Web Strategy"" is available for FREE with the purchase of ANY
GnomeTome (including our 50 freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your
boss doesn't know as much as s/he should.

There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on Emusic now. They inked a deal with
Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any more to get access to
even more MP3s. This is the ONLY way to go, and I hope and pray that more
record labels will eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than
a place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters knowledge; the
Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has encouraged creativity and
commerce. The one thing the Internet is NOT: a fad. Its potential is
limitless, as long as it remains flexible and not controlled by any one
company. This Palladium thing has got me more than a little spooked. It,
combined with the service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that
drives people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate to
admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM. I best not find
out that you're part of the problem.

See You in August,

**Groone's Recipe Holder v1.1.0 [8.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://www.groonesworld.com/rholder.htm

{Recipe lister} The best thing about this recipe holder? The conversion
calculator. I've always wondered how many teaspoons were in a gallon. There
are a few delicious recipes already included, to help you start your
collection of favorites. Everything is nicely divided into categories, too.
Need a salad? Then click ""Soups & Salads."" (Easy!) You can also make shopping
lists. The printing capability is nice too, since I'm assuming most of you
don't keep your computer next to the stove. ""If you have an up-to-date
computer with Win2000, XP, or 98SE with the latest version of IE, then you can
download the version with no runtime support since your computer has all the
necessary files.""

  
**SolarInfo v1.0 [1.1M] FREE**

http://www.sulaco.co.za/downloads.htm

{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have really cool
names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is simply referred to as
""moon?"" We should change it to something catchier, like ""Joey Joe-Joe Junior
Shabbadu."" Don't mind me, I was just looking at this new application. It shows
a graphical representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides detailed
information such as the planet's distance from the sun, its volume, mass, and
gravity in relation to Earth. What I found most interesting was how long a
single ""day"" lasts on different planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is
equal to six days on Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the
Christmas tree for longer than we thought.

**Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software**  
Scribbled by Pat Wong

http://popup.jscentral.com/

I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation menus, and I
thought you might be interested in learning about it. There are several
examples on the company's site, as well as on my own. Here's a small write-up
about it; perhaps you'd be interested in running this in a future Lockergnome
issue? We've all seen a lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up
text, neat mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a combination
of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise that goes way beyond some
of us. At last, it's possible to easily generate just such a menu with some
very user-friendly screens to enter the data you want to use.

Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully licensed
version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the Web Designer
license). The biggest difference? With the licensed version, you get the
ability to save a menu you've generated so you can modify it later. Your only
alternative, if you want to make even a simple change to a menu generated by
the freeware version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or
diving into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be forewarned:
The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that could potentially be a
nightmare. I decided to buy the fully licensed version and I'm really glad I
did. Sorry if I sound like a commercial for the company; I don't work for them
or stand to be compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

**Calculator**  
Unearthed by a Gnomie

http://www.calculator.com/

{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting numbers or
spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside down. How about
figuring out the financing on your new car? What about the seeding rates for
your wheat farm? Perhaps you programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator.
And, of course, what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates
for his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the map
here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of calculator sites
for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve Lafferty: ""In a
recent article over the PayPal issue, it was stated that when using a credit
card illegally, the owner of that card is responsible for the first $50.
However, sometging that very few people know about is that there is a US
Federal provision in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E /
Electronic Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your 'bank card' is
used without your permission, you are not responsible for any of the charges.
My suggestion is never to use a credit card - and only use your bank debit
card. That way, if someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of
the charges."" For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people living in the
USA. If you haven't been watching your statements like a hawk lately, you'd be
wise to start soon. Identity theft is a growing concern. When my wallet was
stolen, I found IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

937;Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>;Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>;Wed, 09 Oct 2002 18:49:59 -0700;Re: Lord of the Ringtones: Arbocks vs. Seelecks;"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his
reign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real
hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame
the regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did
get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind
Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something
very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
very little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be
rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this
period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
didn't want the government forcing business models onto
the private sector.

His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I
got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and
I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support
for Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no difference
between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.
Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable
content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
the content scaling back for each target platform).

The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,
but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.
They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high
roller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.
The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)

Ah well, that's probably just as good anyway...

The ""From ""  envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that  perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with  ""From "".

Can this be done via .forward?  I don't have root on the machine my
mailbox is on, and I'm absolutely certain that a complaint to the sysadmin
about sendmail will get a simple response: shut down the daemon and tell
me to use Outlook. :(

Your sysadmins are wrong.

Whatever program that is used to store the mail into the 
braindead ""mailbox"" file (/var/spool/mail/whatever) is supposed 
to escape a line that begins with From.  That program is called 
the local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

It would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a 
""mailbox"" file.

If your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the 
receiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail 
as the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and 
deliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.

Most Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a
$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.

Correct.

Also correct.  In fairness, though I cannot defend the Content-Length: header
as I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT&T.

James> Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.
James> This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such

Specifically, you will need to find a line in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf that
starts with ""Mlocal"" such as:

[4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/usr/lib/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
[4785] 

and make sure that 'E' appears in the long list of flags following ""F="".
If your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin
should, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:

MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+E')dnl

Also correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such
as slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.

Date: Not supplied

Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 

*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 

Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 

[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 

The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 

In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 

And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 

I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 

*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  

Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 

*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 

- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""


*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

    Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six

    so, practically essential. Then they explain how: 

    ""Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,"" said Joel Joves, a designer with

=== Scissors === 

I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 

    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 

She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 

I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 

*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  

=== Waiting for Wireless === 

Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 

=== Irony === 

According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 

I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 

Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 

=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 

Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 

This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 

=== Arrival === 

I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties.

Date: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00

_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. 

If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: 

- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
number of parsers around the world. 
- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
and inconsistent behavior across consumers. 

RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
format, we have the worst one possible. 

Except, of course, for all the others. 

The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
possible in the first place. 

- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
display through unclosed HTML elements. 
- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
flexibility. 

Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: 

- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
flourishing. 

Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to 
their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. 

- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
There is no middle ground. 
- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
faces. 
- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list 
of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is 
missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
group can design a better system in the long haul. 

Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.

Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. 

The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"".

projects are using cards like the Datakey 330 which seems to store data 
in a way that is proprietary to particular card/reader driver versions.

I've been told, on the other hand, that Java PKI smart cards are very 
interchangable and upward compatible.  The only reasons I've been able 
to find so far for using the more 'proprietary' cards is that they may 
be cheaper and further along in FIPS validation.

In short yes. The more logic involved the longer
the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.

IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-rt6/?t=gr,Redhat=Sockets

The following in google gave useful info also:
""linux IPC mechanisms compared""

fwiw, I can't reproduce this with

  spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1""

which I presume is what you meant (except for the missing args
of course).  They all seem to work OK.

Get more conference info here Back to Top Enterprise Java Education Strategies Floyd Marinescu to co-teach J2EE Patterns - Sept 16, Dallas  Dear TSS Members, I thought you'd be interested to know that The Middleware Company has created a J2EE Patterns training course that I will be co-teaching in Dallas during the week of September 16th. The course combines and improves upon the best J2EE design patterns material available in my book EJB Design Patterns, Sun's Core Patterns, TheServerSide's patterns repository and others.  I have just reviewed the final material and I am very excited with the end product. This class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. One of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including TheServerSide.com.  I highly recommend this course to the seasoned J2EE developer who wants to master the cutting edge in J2EE architecture and design.  If you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:  http://www.middleware-company.com/training/j2eepatterns.shtml Sincerely,  Floyd Marinescu  Author, EJB Design Patterns  Director of TheServerSide.com J2EE Community  Back to Top New Patterns    iXML Pattern     By Venkatesh Balakumar        In due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of Web services, which will granulate into representing all data in XML. For preparing and implementing Web services, it's necessary to express all data in XML. This pattern does the same. Read more on this pattern.  Widget Pages     By Guilherme Silva        This pattern allows for using XMLC and Barracuda without exposing their APIs to widget users. In fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading.  Read more on this pattern. Back to Top New App Server Reviews   JRun 4.0 - Good Stuff      By Jason McKerr        Some general impressions I had of JRun: It's very easy to get it up and running.   Allaire-now-Macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines.  The Java Management Console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.   It's dead easy to plug into just about any IDE (I've done it with JBuilder Enterprise 6, and the Intellij IDEA EAP (Builds 640 -642).  The JSP compiler is smokin! Very, very fast.

DVDs don't use trusted hardware. As for whether it is worth it, that

Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious.""

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
""We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,"" said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
""We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,"" she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.

Any chance you could bring a wire-cutters with you the next time you're 
passing through, and cut their 'net connection? 


Hang on....mini - Mini... the the ETs have seen the Mini advert and have 
decided to get revenge by invading in the form of spambots and small 
'remote' cars. These are the probes that some of the Saucerheads rattle on 
about, probes that are fired into the atmosphere from the mama-ships.

(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.

First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.

Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).

Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.

Thanks for all the effort

Well, you have a pretty good idea of when I might get to it (the

Thanks for considering it.  In the meantime I've set the

Date: Not supplied

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 

    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 

    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
    34-year-old demographic."" 

I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

Date: Not supplied

The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 

    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

Date: Not supplied

The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 

    Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
    ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
    ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about 
    Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 

    Bldhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
    themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: ""The Faster You Go 
    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.""

    looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of 
    Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The

Date: 2002-10-01T12:53:57-05:00

One year ago today, my (now former) manager told me to shut down my weblog and 
remove all traces of it from my server. He tried to convince me that the 
Internet was too small to mix the professional[1] and the personal[2]. 

One year ago today, I gave him my answer[3], and the rest is history[4]. 

Today, to celebrate this anniversary, I would like everyone to read my resume
[5], admire this full-screen picture of my cat[6], and link to this post[7]. 

There are four lights.

Fair enough. > What I'd recommend in your case [...] Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-) What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.

1211;Ben Liblit <liblit@eecs.berkeley.edu>;rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net;Wed, 02 Oct 2002 00:54:56 -0700;alsa-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels;"This is a multi-part message in MIME format. --Boundary_(ID_KtnWPrcWHTTzQa7OHxPjiA) Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my  kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec  that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that  freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind,  including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will  consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation. The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a  conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it  is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If  the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using  ""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined. The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that  kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request.

YOUR MONEY 

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.

SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Excellent evidence of the herd. Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting. 

Oh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 




 

Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""


Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. 

""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. 

On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" 

Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""


Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. 

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. 

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. 

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. 

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization. 

""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."" 

She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to. 

Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all,
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining
a recent metaphor.

I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude,
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.

Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""),
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""),
even PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion
in the Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.

So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could
only have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the
edition of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time
over the course of a year talking about what's _wrong_ with our system than
what's right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get
would be a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my
comments or those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right?
People would disagree with an article that said we spend much time
disagreeing. This, of course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical
way - the perfect recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more
perfectly by the eventual inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of
someone from _outside_ the US disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness
as Americans. Ideally, they would be comments that disagreed with our
collective American perception of being disagreeable. They would, of course,
point out things about which citizens of other countries can disagree with
Americans on. By exercising the right to disagree, we'd subtly agree that we
have that right. Yet another level of recursion and a final layer of metaphor.

The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming.
In the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of
the two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting
opinion published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express
honestly held opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the
circle on the metaphor in a perfect way.

Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not
sure whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's
just been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader
who will remain mercifully nameless:

> We get enough America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and
> schools here in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite
> adjective here) from Belgium whining too!

Followed by:

> ... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation of
> Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who
> would be able to replace him.

... and, in a later note on the topic ...

> Censorship is to be encouraged in a free-market society whenever and
> wherever it doesn't come from the government.

Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.

Chris has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the
editorial piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is
no exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.

So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue
to occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.

Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye
out.

**Win Apps in Linux?**

Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by
CodeWeavers \- CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of
both by now, as they've garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of
the Linux world. You'll recall that I promised to try to secure copies for
review this week. With the help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was
able to accomplish that task this morning. True to the second half of the
promise, we'll spend the next few days looking at these two products and how
they might impact your Linux use. Let's take them in chronological order,
starting today with CrossOver Plugin.

A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past
several years, an ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's
a tough goal, but it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past
year or so. Though the progress has been slow, the Wine project has managed to
stay at the front of this development realm.

CrossOver Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior
to its release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows
applications in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no
small amount of configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from
the system-wide approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than
executing at system startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual
Windows path to the called program. When the program is closed, so is Wine.
CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with _one_
related set of Windows applications: browser plugins.

The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media
Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible
browser plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian,
Authorware Web Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every
need plugin need covered.

But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several Microsoft-
oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications offered
by the CodeWeavers developers.

Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did
want these apps to work.

The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script
from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver
Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the
plugin installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar
sight \- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first
checked for feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window,
then stepped out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the
install failed four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a
failure of the CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some
persistence, managed to get a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the
Apple servers. Quite literally, the install looked and performed exactly as
I've seem many times in Windows. When the install was completed, CrossOver
again checked for the Windows binary, located the appropriate .dll files in
the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the plugins into the
/home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins directories.

The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime
plugin was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In
Black II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.

I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me
to the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done.
Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.

Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went
as smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a
much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact,
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.

I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda.
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.

Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With
the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to
development, Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows
applications seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so
strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins
actually run better in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't
realize how much I missed them until I started using them in Linux today.

Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office
package.

**Kernel Configuration - Part IX**

We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear
decision as to how to configure each section.

Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.

Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows
printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example,
the builds I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as
the telescope cameras were attached to this port.

Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP,
or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and
will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your
printer following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in
the BIOS.

Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

to better manage their disease.

""We are a totally non profit camp that puts all money from fees into our camp.
We pay no salaries to Physicians, Dietitians, Social Workers, Nurses and
educators that make our camp possible. Yes even me the lowly web master
donates his time and web space at ATT to the cause.

""ATT recently decided to pull access to our photo page due to a password
protection. We give out a password to all parents so that they can see photos
of camp while the sessions are happening. We do not however what the creeps of
the web to have access to photos of our kids.

""We are looking for someone in the state to help our camp by donating web
space. Now it may not be your organization, but I know Linux people and
Lockergnome and I think someone there may know someone who would be able to
help us.

""You can still have access to the public part of our site that ATT has not
shut down at www.fcyd-inc.org.

""Please I have the parents of 120 diabetic kids wanting to see photos of their
children. They are all e-mailing me and I have no one to turn to.

""Hoping to hear from someone soon.""

This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most    attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty    editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,    film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big    brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process    soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record    ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and    up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music    production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind    to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen.

Since it makes    full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,    you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like    without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The    program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming    interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address    book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves    awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:    http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSenMA07qVX4RVXFO5JSFR     Want to review Captain FTP?

AquilaCalendar is    refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar    windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,    week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize    your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists    and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a    handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The    interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting    organized no more difficult than it has to be.

This handy little editor offers    all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,    translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,    and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be    able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client    such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit.

Even if you    don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a    spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while    setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll    also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear    of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through    eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10    subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came    from.

**Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi**  
Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening
to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and
allow others to freely tap into their Internet access. Time Warner Cable of
New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their
accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within
300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send
additional letters, while AT&T; Broadband also is preparing similar letters
for some of its customers.

**Apple's iPod comes to Linux**  
Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music
player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple
Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in
San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player
software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will,
tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of
music.

**Judge OKs suit against Kazaa parent**  
A federal judge said Monday that record labels and film studios could expand
an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes
the popular Kazaa software. The Recording Industry Association of America
(RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) sued three
prominent file-swapping companies in October in Los Angeles federal court. The
suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the
Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.

270;=?iso-8859-1?q?Paul=20Linehan?= <plinehan@yahoo.com>;ilug@linux.ie;Tue, 8 Oct 2002 23:51:52 +0200 (CEST);Re: [ILUG] Interesting article on free software licences;"I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).

Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.

My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.



The article makes four main points.


1) Absence of critical clauses. 


In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.


2) Specification in English only.

That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.


3) Arbitary licence change.

The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.


{

David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.

Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*

That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).

}



4) Hidden defects.

Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.


{

Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.

Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.

I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).


Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. 

See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.


The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.

}



5) Roughly.

There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.



-----  Whole Article. -----------


Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.


Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.



Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.


Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.



Absence of critical clauses.



The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).

The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).



Specification in the English language.



Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. 

The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 


Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.


A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.


Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.


In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 


The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".


An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 


For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.


You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.


You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. 

Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 


The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.


The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)


This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. 

This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.


LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". 

OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.



Roughly Speaking.


Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. 

During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. 

In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.


The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

I've been using another 6.x repository though. http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself, though. _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list";1;0

THE CHAIRMAN	
by NICHOLAS LEMANN
He's the other Powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.
New Yorker, October 8, 2002

Last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first 
fairly serious American-history course, indignantly reported that the 
whole subject was incomprehensible. I was shocked. What about Gettysburg 
and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? 
Just look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His 
class had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big 
beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, 
there was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text 
and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous 
decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American 
history. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and 
reciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping 
for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation 
of freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it 
become possible to see the federal government's main function as 
responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, 
instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic 
interests.

Even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty 
speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find 
is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so 
much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real 
estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which 
this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and 
commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's 
an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because 
the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon
can't get themselves interested.

One corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal 
Communications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand 
denizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate 
commerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that 
the commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription 
price: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they 
grumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where 
the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating 
comedy routine by the commission's chairman.

Of all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that 
Americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with 
a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the 
American economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone 
and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now 
F.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, 
because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the 
""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies 
regulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, 
among others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is 
part of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney 
analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the 
embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the 
past two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions 
of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a 
dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.

This year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state 
of the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes 
F.C.C. World's feverish mood (""The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns"") 
and suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of 
the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I 
just quoted is followed by this explanation: ""The ILECs appear likely to 
enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no 
residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% 
market share loss in business lines to CLECs."" It's a lot easier to 
think about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.


Even in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the 
commission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially 
intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes 
itself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael 
Powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, 
because he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. 
Unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which 
generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about 
who he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the 
head of a federal agencyhe is thirty-nineand genially charming. 
Everybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years 
one of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the 
F.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the 
arcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an 
""avid moderate."" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his 
predecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell 
to Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, 
calls him ""radical and extreme."" Just as often as he's accused of being 
a right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically 
cautious. ""It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,"" 
another former chairman, William Kennard, says. ""You have to have an 
answer."" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate 
subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the 
subcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated 
him. ""You don't care about these regulations,"" Hollings said. ""You don't 
care about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the 
fundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over 
there. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and 
seem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive 
vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a 
regulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your 
job?""

""Extremely,"" Powell said, with an amiable smile.


One cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats 
and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose 
of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was 
created by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the 
New Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy 
cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure 
that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its 
other original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, 
the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers 
unfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, 
well-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial 
supervisionits real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition 
among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by 
artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. 
In addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission 
more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many 
of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most 
terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank 
president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. 
According to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once 
blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers 
in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the 
anti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV 
station in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.


F.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, 
because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic 
niches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful 
breakup of A.T. & T.by far the biggest and most important company the 
commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of 
self-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation 
ago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one 
long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, 
which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same 
company. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the 
mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local 
phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing 
to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores 
everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand 
millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the 
telephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a ""natural 
monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total 
control over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, 
the F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones 
and the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: 
consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more 
prosperous, too.

The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 
one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which 
most people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. 
Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of 
modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group 
bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers 
as ""baby Bells"" and to F.C.C. World as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version 
of RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to 
offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance 
companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for 
customers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would 
get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more 
competition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and 
economics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by 
Vice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as 
helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that 
brought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose 
beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's 
slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to 
the twenty-first century,"" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully 
sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical 
correlates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was 
supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.

The F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, 
aggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like 
all important interest groups they work with both parties); they 
immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new 
competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through 
rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by 
Reed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep 
the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies 
like A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new 
companies, ""see-lecks"" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive 
local exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory 
equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have 
access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the 
seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the 
F.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.

Partly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that 
he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming 
condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the 
see-leckscompanies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligentand 
into other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related 
technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom 
boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks 
and other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests 
of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's 
former lieutenants told me, ""Reed used to joke that my job was to make 
sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""


The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the 
boom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more 
startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: 
Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and 
Comcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys 
believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative 
accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so 
undiscriminating.)

By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been 
determined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the 
chairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of 
influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. 
Three Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and 
Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as 
such, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most 
powerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of 
S.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant 
that the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he 
might be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he 
wasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative 
movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than 
Furchtgott-Roth.

Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared 
before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and 
gave a very Michael Powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and 
free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)that 
began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new 
telecom companies alive. ""In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is 
often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" Powell said. ""Like the 
Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast 
beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the 
deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's 
fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the 
least, so it is thought."" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became 
chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as 
part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day 
of the Bush Administration.

Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead 
or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in 
serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite 
companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically 
concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing 
companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in 
good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged 
companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the 
financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications 
industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells 
wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and 
if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national 
duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. 
And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the 
poor health of the long-distance companies.

The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national 
companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they 
don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more 
fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part 
of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 
Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were 
significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of 
radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five 
per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news 
programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary 
of Viacom.

In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should 
be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the 
rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try 
to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should 
disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the 
forces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle 
to get new technologyespecially fast Internet connectionsinto the 
homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An 
analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and 
the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush 
people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush 
people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many 
expectations and stirred too many passions.)

But Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been 
conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the 
F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him 
signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of 
the F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has 
been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further 
infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and 
the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of 
F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's 
having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, 
when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital 
divide""that is, economic inequality in access to the Internethe said, 
""You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and 
I can't afford one."" At the National Cable & Telecommunications 
Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of 
tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a 
somersault.


Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until 
1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest 
Washington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at 
the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody 
else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building 
looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. 
Even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and 
fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and 
walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a 
jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because 
of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he 
became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly 
the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of 
the market before the fact""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayshould 
wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust 
litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and 
then became a protg of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division 
of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's 
legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of 
the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political 
skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush 
Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but 
also maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of 
Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his 
enduring love of law school""It's sort of like a law-school study 
session over there,"" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to 
confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law 
students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.

I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions 
of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the 
airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?

""I think we'll never know,"" Powell said. ""I don't think it's an 
automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably 
the best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and 
say, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor 
puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law 
about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If 
a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a 
similar proposition. There are scholars who argueindeed, the famous 
Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisthat 
spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds 
of ways that we're accustomed to.""

Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he 
doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He 
slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in 
ironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who 
enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions 
about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he 
sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he 
thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act had been excessive.

""I would start with a caveat,"" Powell said. ""Look, I can't fault those 
judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. 
They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. 
But, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, 
anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close 
to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President 
on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I 
don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, 
or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that 
were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts 
reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. 
But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet 
excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it 
certainly was.

""But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of 
expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the 
economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically 
exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by 
politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a 
gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones 
that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to 
see numbers go up on the board.""

Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. "" 
'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see 
thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the 
Bells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" Now Powell returned 
to being Powell. ""I think that expectation was astonishingly 
unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're 
there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And 
the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no 
question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much 
debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business 
model.""

How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? ""We could have 
chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were 
slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" 
Powell said. ""Money chased what seemed like government-promised 
opportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're 
in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This 
debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some 
ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.""

Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there 
had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""No, we wouldn't have 
every home in America with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. I 
don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy 
that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The 
part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so 
would MCI WorldCom and Sprint.""

Other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable 
businesses, either, and they never might. ""Everybody's always saying, 
'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's 
quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six 
years to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once 
every thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're 
looking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance 
business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is 
breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.""

Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies 
stronger? ""At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political 
answer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try 
to help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. 
I can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. 
investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have 
those kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, 
companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from 
dying."" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think 
it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has 
demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist 
gesturesin August, for example, five months after disbanding the 
F.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was 
appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the 
communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding 
out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore 
up the telecom industry.

I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one 
company provided cable television and only one provided local phone 
service. ""Yes,"" he said. ""It concerns us that there's one of each of 
those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one 
of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications 
capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" 
Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to 
provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will 
provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. 
""So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question 
is, Does it stay that way?""

The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of 
information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that 
people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, 
which distorts markets. ""If this were just economics, it's easy. If you 
were to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we 
know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a 
market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is 
other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take 
the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption 
there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic 
viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I 
think that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility 
that's ascribed to it sometimes.""

Powell explained, ""Sometimes when we see very pointed political or 
parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the 
same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh 
exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off 
the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, 
and then we have policies like""here his tone went from ironic to 
sarcastic""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis 
of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed 
and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic 
fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""


F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he 
can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries 
he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the 
market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying 
water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is 
planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed 
Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything 
at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's 
waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, 
so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the 
crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television 
networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of 
Telecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never 
commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, 
and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he 
says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and 
irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.

""This is why elections matter,"" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what 
has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.much 
more than, say, the war in Afghanistanis a case in which a Gore 
Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush 
Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but 
there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The 
arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would 
have done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that 
helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the 
arbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe 
long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their 
friends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not 
unrecognizably different from America's past.";1;0

to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer

uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism. Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries. Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations. The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover, the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development. European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear - the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere in the world. On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of the US literally fantastic. At least, for now. Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European intellectual and political elite. The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America, however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic, authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results. Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume, therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights. None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase. That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism. --  ----------------- R. A.

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.  They are SOL.

Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned

No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.

The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.

This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before
and after (or equivalent).

Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
(The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)

In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
different paths coming vs. going.

Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
is echoed from remote.)

 Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK 

 Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 

 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 

 Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"",  meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same  time.

[Still trying to catch my breath] :-)

I guess there's no easy way to avoid this. In order to proactively
protect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into
their defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and
heuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running
into false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these
some are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.
Consider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft
software without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to
protect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.
malicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason. Looking
at http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/ says it all!  ;-)

Product: libpng
Keywords: Red Carpet libpng buffer overflow

References: 
Release Notes for libpng 
ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207

libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files.

The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.

These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
leaks in reading image functions.

Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.

Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
from the Ximian FTP site:

Yeah yeah yeah. I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum
cleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would
really like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.

Er, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro
specific, anyway.

I am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script
changes. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.

I do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are
picked up by silo. So:
  boot disk linux

would not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there
it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be
automatic from there on.

The problem is that the time between linux booting and when the console tty
drivers are started can be a black hole, without error messages or log in
prompts. The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM
on shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or
keyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power
switch hidden at the back of the case.

I think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is
/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down
properly.

it's been a while since i did a kickstart install.  my memory is that
you put a file on a standard redhat boot disk that essentially scripts
the install.  there are a slew of options - you can have it fetch it's
install script from a tftpd server for instance (similar to jumpstart),
or it can all be on the floppy.

I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo,  and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it. As far as I remember the problem I was having was  that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's  RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,  and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,  and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.

 But the PROMs are for specific network cards, and all their are really is
a bootp/tftp client. Not the whole set of nice bits & pieces you get with
an OpenBoot PROM.

 AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking
like it would just be on workstations from day one. They seemed to drop
it, and go for the crappy MSDOS compatible BIOS though.

 I've just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long
absence.

 There is a nice need 'add_install_client' script that you feed the
archtecture, ethernet address & ip to, and it'll setup everything from
RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple.

 This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
Wyse is trying to do.

 To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
Then you are flying.

 Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?

sorry, i missed this.  redhat supplies something similar called kickstart
(guess who inspired them?).  pc hardware is dumb, so you'll need to use
a floppy.  otoh, every jumpstart config i've seen required rarp plus
plugging the new box's ethernet+ip into a file.  a kickstart boot can

By Anton Chuvakin

Reading logs is a crucial part of incident detection and response.
However, it is easy for security personnel to be overwhelmed by the sheer
volume of logs. This article will offer a brief overview of log analysis,
particularly: log transmission, log collection and log analysis. It will
also briefly touch upon log storing and archival.

by Charl van der Walt

This article is the third in a series that is designed to help readers to
assess the risk that their Internet-connected systems are exposed to. In
the first installment, we established the reasons for doing a technical
risk assessment. In the second part, we started to discuss the methodology
that we follow in performing this kind of assessment. In this installment,
we will continue to discuss methodology, particularly visibility and
vulnerability scanning.

Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.

When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.

A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.

The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:

Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.

A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.

The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.

An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.

3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:

dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.

dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.

This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.

This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.

Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.

When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.

Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.

An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.

Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:

phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.

A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.

It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.

6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:

shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.

Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.

This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.

7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:

Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.

The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.

Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.

9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:

super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.

super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.

The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.

10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369
Summary:

Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.

A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.

Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.

This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.

11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:

The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.

A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.

The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.

Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.

It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.

Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.

This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.

When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.

15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:

OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.

Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.

The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.

'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.

The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/

It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.

FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57

The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports
directory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Note that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.

*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh
are available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following
MD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:

MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Well, you have to add the workstation to the install server first.

Talking of which, you can install Sparc Linux using this technique as well.
The image takes a while to load, but once this is done you can install in
the normal fashion.

SuSe for Sparc works fine. I am using Debian because the Sun boxen I have
subverted do not have graphics consoles. It also just works.

If you have a spare workstation, I am sure I could burn a couple of CD's for
you. (If I can find them.)

You need db3 or db4 development files at least, and once everything installed you'll need to initialize your rpm database.

(We did consider running Linux md RAID on the disks but RAID > gives you no protection against slips of the finger) Do I get beaten round the head for saying ""floppy""? Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this might slow you down by all of 60 seconds. Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a bootp and tftp server somewhere.... hth, Ronan. --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

just keep root as hda, you can change boot all you want, that's
where it will get written when you run lilo from the prompt.
just have a sane lilo.conf (with root=/dev/hda) and use lilo -b
to write to different devices.

I would question anything being ready for ""production"" being in
STABLE.

He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.

My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
there are no license issues there :)

 Best thing to do would be to have each of those addresses going to a

I don't know Mutt, to be honest, but the KDE mail client ""KMail"" can
do this very neatly - you set up multiple ""Identity"" profiles, each
with a distinct email address (and other things if desired, like a GPG
key and a signature).  You can then set up KMail to use various
identities automatically when replying to messages which match a
particular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc.  It's
all very cool, and it works very nicely.

But I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.

Limbo seems to be able to compile its own kernel with its own gcc 3.1. 
That said, I don't want to know what kind of patches Redhat are applying 
to that kernel. The .spec file alone is 128KBytes! One of the patches is 
2.4.19-ac10. Redhat don't seem to have patched Limbo's gcc too heavily.

Coincidentally enough, I'm currently in the middle of a pretty good book 
about the Francis Drake scam called ""Drake's Fortune"" by Richard Raynor.

Despite being pretty familiar with the whole 419 scam stuff (see my earlier 
FoRK post from a few months back about how the whole scam works: 
http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-May/011928.html) I never put the 
two together as being related.

Apparently, I suck at pattern matching.

(Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) 

Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running
into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form
of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.

One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars
from around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report
(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go
'check out' the scam.  (3).

Listen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably
common.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,
to London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'
of Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have 
an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted 
hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a 
monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the 
system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to 
decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled 
and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.

This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  

What do you think ?

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,

Secure and at ease
ByJack Mccarthy
August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT

MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.

Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.

A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.

""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""

Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.

""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.""

Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.

Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.

Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""

Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.

""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20

PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.

""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
Litan says.

To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.""";1;0

Making a mesh on the move

A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter Rojas

Peter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The Guardian

Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.

This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.

Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.

As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.

Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.

The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.

Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.

It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.

All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.

But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.

At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.

But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.

The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.

When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.";1;0

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking

Anyone any ideas?

Hey, look at that!

       DROPPRIVS   If  set  to	`yes'  procmail  will drop all privileges

Of course, removing setuid/gid bits on programs that don't need it is
always a good idea.  A general rule of system administration: don't give
out permissions unless you absolutely need to.   ;)

$ find /dir -name \*  | xargs du -s | sort -n

Smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end. So if
you want to get the 5 largest files, pipe through tail.

e.g.

$ find /dir -name \*  | xargs du -s | sort -n | tail -5

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:

http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.

Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
implications, unless it's just BS.

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...

But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the problem, I have just been playing).

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

You can't, because there isn't one, yet.  Habeas is using a 
combination of copyright and trademark law to protect their 
sender warranties.  They hope to patent the system, but they 
have not been ISSUED a patent.

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/lcc-sph082202.php

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:

    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,

    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and

* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.

To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.

""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread 
applications.""";1;0

A bizarre collection of stuffed animals could fetch up to 2m when it is
sold by a Cornwall museum.
The Museum of Curiosities is home to a menagerie of 10,000 Victorian stuffed
animals.
The museum, next to the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor, gets about 30,000
visitors a year.
But now the inn's owner Kevin Moore has decided to sell.

Stuffed frogs are for sale

Mr Moore said: ""It was very fashionable to have taxidermy on your
mantlepiece in Victorian times, but it is not really in favour now.""
Nevertheless, figures of up to 2m for the collection have been discussed.
The museum was opened in 1861 by taxidermist Walter Potter.
Tableaux include a kittens tea party, cricket-playing guinea pigs and
swinging frogs.

NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot 
from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it 
to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. 

After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS 
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little 
at a loss I must say.

I don't think I could argue that ZODB is more reliable that BerkeleyDB.  It's true that we have fewer database experts and expend fewer resources working on database reliability.  On the other hand, Barry is nearly finished with a BerkeleyDB-based storage for ZODB. ZODB is an object persistence tool that uses a database behind it.

liberalism
propagandized as meddling

""American liberalism believes that in this respect it has made a major
contribution to the grand strategy of freedom. Where both capitalists and
socialists in the 1930's were trying to narrow the choice to either/or --
either laissez-faire capitalism or bureaucratic socialism -- the New Deal
persisted in its vigorous faith that human intelligence and social
experiment could work out a stable foundation for freedom in a context of
security and for security in a context of freedom. That faith remains the
best hope of free society today.""

the ""independent"", a shopper's newspaper in the sf bay area, (the
operational definition of that media category is ""no matter how hard

aug 24, 2002:

""Dot-com downturn linked to domestic violence""

Domestic-violence worker Kathy Black remembers watching the Nasdaq 
take a nastydive on MSNBC, in March 2000.

""I knew then that we would have a lot of work on our hands,"" Black said,
referring to the caseload at La Casa de las Madres, the city's largest
organization serving women and children affected by domestic violence.

She was right.

Calls to La Casa's crisis line increased by 33% in the last financial
year, and the service saw a 10 percent increase in the demand for
beds, with 232 women and 215 children utilizing the shelter service.
...

Black said the dot-com collapse and a growing awareness of La Casa's
services were the two main reasons for the increase in calls.

She said many of her clients had partners who were employed in
service-industry jobs utilized by dot-com workers   
...

me!

Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.

>>From the spamc man page:

       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.


The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:

       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.


I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

| Hi All,
|

| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|

| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which

|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?

Easy.

First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen

Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
under Prefs->Hacking Support)

It's going to look something like this:

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)

You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!

Issue of 2002-04-01 Posted 2002-03-25 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has resumed its governance-and about time, too. The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs. Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline. Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this Administration also served under the President's father. They took office last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off. Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the world, and these words: Defense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney January 1993 One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard, and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing Carnegie Hall? After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the new grand strategy. Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who, perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush, using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed. The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being ""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material. As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,"" meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose."" When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating world affairs for any length of time. One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking. Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new, aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric, especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging, because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking. Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999 study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the military or the civilian lite believes; for example, the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further. Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest' in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush, she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm, rather than belligerence. In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist, putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to productive and coperative relations with the United States, rather than to try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained."" Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is, the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again."" The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is working on the report now. ""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that, since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction that it's going."" It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East, and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago. Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration, and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term. ""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the ""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony. The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional great-power politics."" Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department- in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff, beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies. It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book. ""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."" I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way. If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States, gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when, and not if, you're going to be attacked."" Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said. ""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense."" On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."" He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S. foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade, democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more."" The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath. Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask, evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete ""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt."" Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground troops. Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam. This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in Afghanistan. Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra. ""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack. That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan, which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq, if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way that Europe was immediately after the Second World War. In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation. The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,"" and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.) Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on, if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the Iraq operation. When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal 2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of Iraq. This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions, are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will begin soon. Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only truly prudent course. When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder, filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer. ""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush, former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis, and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas. No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no, and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are morally weak.' "" Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world. He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example. There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But, instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the states of Southwest Asia more generally."" We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,"" Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years."" ""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"" He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior."" --  ----------------- R. A.

Carny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations: 

    In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country. 

    ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of

    As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... 

    Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the

Date: Not supplied

Great article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. 

    For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population. 

    The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.

DVDSynth is an open source project that allows you to splice in your own

highlight reels for your favorite movies, etc, etc. It all amounts to a sweet 
tool for making the audience into the _former audience_, participants in 
entertainment. Of course, it's also illegal under the DMCA, since the tool also 
necessarily circumvents the copy-prevention in pre-recorded DVDs to accomplish 
its ends. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via NTK[3]_)

Javawalk is a coffee-oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. 

    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!

Date: Not supplied

Janis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented 
science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry. 

    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - 
    not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux 
    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy 
    saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is 
    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. 
    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the 
    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market 
    consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less 
    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because 
    that's all you'll be able to find out there.

Article about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter 
belonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he 
thinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store. 

    Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little 
    girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not 
    getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."" 

I don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are 
getting a bad rap about being con-artists. This Irish Traveler FAQ[1] says 
""some Travellers are con men, but, just like other Americans, most are not.""

with him in the future. I don't say that lightly. This evening he posted a note
[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside 
RSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm 
me. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things 
""RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news 
feeds. That's all it is for, for the 18,000th time."" It's time for RDF to pack 
its bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once 
and for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS 
alone. Thank you.

Date: 2002-09-23T23:21:12-06:00

Finally finished up (most of) TRAMP, my RDF interface for Python. (If you don't 
use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  

New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  

_But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
if you're not already convinced.



    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same 
    time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*



Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.

Date: 2002-09-23T09:27:30-05:00

No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 

My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 

Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 

For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.

Date: 2002-09-23T16:11:02-05:00

Trust me when I tell you that heavy medication and RDF do not mix. Here is a 
list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in 
index.html[2]. 
- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. 
- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF
[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. 
- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the 
brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to 
yesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? 
Today's newzzz... Never mind. 
- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a 
FOAF file from an RSS feed. 
- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward 
compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. 
- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such 
as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. 
- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to 
accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing 
list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. 
- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.&#8221; 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to 
making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to 
give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... 
and plunks it into the oil.&#8221;

_Shelley Powers_: &#8220;I thought the stuff this weekend on FOAF was a joke[1]
&#8212;a bunch of people playing with new toys. ... How does FOAF aid 
aggregation? The author is included with each bit. Why do we need extraneous

_Seth Russell_: &#8220;For example I wanted to know who _you_ were[2]. Only 
thing I had was your posts to this list. So i found ""burningbird.net"" in your 
email address ... then i did a lot of reading over there. Still don't really 
know who your are and what you are into, what projects you are working on, who 
you know, and why you came here to run your mouth. But if there were a foaf 
button on the feed from this channel, well I just click on that and i'm totally

Lately, a fairly large % of the spam I've been getting has been coming from
spam systems that forge my own address as the ""from"" address... Those spam
messages would get through any whitelist I set up (especially since I email
stuff to myself all the time).  If whitelists become more popular, I
imagine spammers will resort to doing that for the majority of their spams,
making whitelists less helpful.

Plus, I'm still not sure how I feel about whitelists.  I don't think I'm so
special that people should need to fill out a special form just to send me
email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
(especially those with multiple email addresses...).

Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. 

I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)

Well, just to take this thread off topic - does anyone know what's

So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs.
solicited commercial email?

I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.

Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.

1997. Set in the old west.

A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.

The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.

The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.

On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

Hmmm... installed SA 2.40, but I get the same error when trying
to launch amavisd-new (can't find Razor/Client.pm).  Seems like
the amavis code is calling for this.  I'll hit up the
amavis-users list.  (Feel free to fire off the answer if you
have it, though!   :)

Yes, that is perfectly legitimate.  It is a math / accounting thing.
You get a paycheck for $100.  You get a bill for $20.  You add them
up.  Some of the additions are negitive debit amounts.  My bank
statement always has a long list of + items and - items.  If I can
keep the + items more than the - items I am doing good.

To paraphrase something I heard once:
Unless you like looking for a new job, never install a non-released or
development-only version of software anywhere where the results of such
code are important.

ie: Don't run development code on a production machine. :)


The problem isn't SA anyway, it looks for Razor1 and just keeps on
going if it can't find it.  Something came up about amavis on the SA
list where it looks for Razor itself...

I have such a system.  It works like this :
    1)  sa-exim scans the message during the SMTP interaction
    2)  if it scores high enough it is rejected
        2.1)    if it is rejected, exim mentions that in the reject log
        2.2)    if it isn't rejected it is delivered
            2.2.1)  it is up to the user to deal with (filter as
                    desired) the lower-scoring spam
    3)  I have a script run as a daily cron job to run through the
        reject log and deposit a report in the user's home directory
        indicating what was rejected and way (SA isn't the only cause
        for rejection)

Obviously my setup is rather tied to exim and sa-exim, but if you want
the reporting script I can send it to you.

Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK. Kragen, do you know of any? I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org) that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post, no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting. For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin, or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them. So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even if it looks like spam. So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I guess I would have received it in a timely fashion. So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

Looks cute. For what it's worth I worked closely with a few
of the people on the team. One was my officemate for years.

Unfortunately there's no way I'm loading all the .NET stuff
on my machine. Not yet. And hopefully by the time it's all
stable, I'll be running FreeBSD again on my laptop, and it will
be moot anyway.

A quick Google search turns up:

http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/streaming/index.html
Darwin streaming media server

http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open Streaming

MPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.

Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.

Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.


Both sound interesting, and low $$.

People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'. Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff away Friday September 8, 2000 ... On the way down from the roof, through the ""workers' quarters"" which Van Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the subject of peasants, expanding on the ""worthless"" and ""lazy"" majority who make up the council estates of this country. ""You are playing up to your villainous image,"" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed. ""I'm not villainous,"" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard and hard labour is what distinguishes the ""riff-raff"" from the ""elite"". I ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, ""old-moneyed bastards"" whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as ""those rat bags drawing social security."" ... He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the public mourning, remembers being pleased. ""I was glad,"" he says. ""He was only in it for the ego trip."" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. ""She made us look like fools,"" he says. ""She made a mockery of the royal family."" Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says gloopily, ""they are all we've got, so we have to respect them."" He says he favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible because ""the power has gone to their heads."" (Mugabe himself is the most modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming).

Was there any science in there? All I saw was more of the ""myth of the 
liberal media."" Every opinion supporting global warming was ""the media"", 
every opinion against it was an ""expert."" A brief perusal of the rest of 
the web site and I'm left wondering where the science
is.
And, to put on my extremist hat, every organization or scientist in 
there was American. Big deal - a bunch of scientists being trotted out 
to support government and industrial policy that is the ultimate source 
of their livelihood and research money. If the government changes their 
mind on Kyoto, they'll trot out another group of tame scientists. And 
all the American papers will switch back to warning us about climate change.

Cheers, RAH http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-072302B Just Ask the Experts By Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon 07/23/2002 In 2001 the National Science Foundation surveyed 1,500 people nationwide and found that 77% believed that ""increased carbon dioxide and other gases released into the atmosphere will, if unchecked, lead to global warming ..."" Yet half of those polled believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed on Earth, despite the scientific fact that the dinosaurs went extinct tens of millions of years before the earliest hominids appeared. Worse, only 22% of the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide - is. As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public ignorance about scientific matters. Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about global warming from human activities, no wonder most people ""believe"" that global warming ""will"" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% ""worry a great deal"" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13 environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those polled, was polluted drinking water. So What Do We Know? Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are three points we know from the science:    1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.       But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat) and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago, and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900 C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.     # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining past climate or making projections for future trends. Future Shock: The Scenarios When it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (2000), ""Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They are neither predictions nor forecasts."" Further, ""The possibility that any single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly uncertain,"" and finally, ""No judgement is offered in this Report as to the preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations."" Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's "" ... 40 energy scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics strongly bias their projections."" Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate forecast. Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements of how the climate has changed in the last few decades. Complete Speculation On May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, ""The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative. Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen."" Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases where good measurements are available: ""For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ... that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35 million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important contributors to natural variability."" Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000: ""The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have."" This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate result. Think Locally Now, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on ""highly uncertain"" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular media, which would be where most people learn about the issue. The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002: ""Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability... Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated."" The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, ""[T]here is currently insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections. For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for Policymakers, p. 15)."" A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations: ""Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such predictions - called ""verification"" - is simply impossible, since we have to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ... climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more significant impact on society than annual average global temperature trends.""

I don't work in this area, but I have a suspicion that many people
suspect projects for ""knowledge management"" and ""knowledge sharing"" as
attempts to eliminate their jobs, or at least their importance. If ""the
organization"" knows all the things I know, why does it need me?

This should actually be easy to test experimentally: compare the results
of having someone call up and say, ""Can you show us how to do X for this
project we're working on?"" with those of having someone summoned by a
knowledge management project to explain how to do X for the knowledge
archives.

We had a pretty serious crash on the list host over the weekend, and it
destroyed all configuration data.  As a result, I've had to rebuild the
mailing list from various other sources -- including the archives of
past list traffic.

If you're a list subscriber, you may have received a ""welcome to the list""
mail. All well and good.  However, if you *used* to be subscribed to one 
of the lists at some point in 2002, or never were (I'm hoping that didn't
happen!), you may have also have received one of these.  Just go to the

necessary.

If you're a list admin on any of the lists at lists.boxhost.net or

settings match up with what they used to be.

Sorry about this :(

America Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts
Updated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ET

Dow Jones Newswires

NEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its
instant-messaging service compatible with rival services.

The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory
filing it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are
more limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications
Commission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.

America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable
with others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be
incentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress
reports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent
report, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.

The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't
much closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,
according to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing
instant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an
America Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using
third-party software such as Trillian.

America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized
for blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The
company also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at
interoperability.

For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of
its users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other
companies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.

When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America
Online wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced
instant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to
enable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival
services. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from
widening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its
access to Time Warner cable systems.

AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.

Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a
technology known as ""server-to-server interoperability"" before it could
offer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services
to detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so
via communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging
provider, using a common language.

But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said
it will ""focus its efforts"" on alternatives to server-to-server
interoperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.

As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to
make its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service
from Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will
be included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release
in August.

IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't
involve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of
messages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat
customers use Apple software.

""We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short
term, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide
interoperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,"" Steven
Teplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to
the FCC.

As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan
said Tuesday: ""It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard
nut to crack for the entire industry."" Indeed, users of America Online's
rival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.

The alternative solution ""was something that we could implement now to
provide for IM communities to communicate,"" said Ms. McKiernan, adding
America Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,
similar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.

FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.

America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday
implement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the
technology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus
Development, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,
msgs).

But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was ""limited in scope
and functionality."" True server-to-server technology ""would require further
significant expenditures of time and resources to develop,"" wrote Mr.
Teplitz.

The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet
standards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but
hasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task
force representatives couldn't be reached.

The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant
messaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,
analyst with Jupiter Research.

""It's still something the market wants,"" he said. ""At some point, it'll
happen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.""

Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively
pursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user
base. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground
because prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another
provider, as long as they can reach America Online users.

But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,
America Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and
Yahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL
has denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its
system interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.

But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are
catching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base
rose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's
base jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of
users of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.

So here's the final report on the HD/ID party. As no less than TEN 
forkers pointed out, the invitation, while sent on Sunday 6/30, was only 
delivered ten days later on 7/9.

It got flagged as spam.

Yes, on a mailing list awash in crap -- and some it is even unsolicited 
commercial email, heavens! -- our trusty mailman filters captured and 
quarantined just two posts that week, one from me that was > 100K (the 
fat articles) and one that was bcc:d (the invite).

Now, it was a little difficult to recalibrate self-esteem, which as you 
can imagine was proportional to the two-digit attendance  -- in binary!

According to the George Washington documentary, I almost had as much 
alcohol on hand than he did -- Virginia tradition being to copiously 
lubricate each voter. Election day was a public festival day, and it 
cost poor George an average of SIXTY-FOUR shots of hard liquor PER VOTER 
that day...

So, herewith is the prize for most appropriate flame my delayed invite 
got:

One of our competitors added:
> Wow - I just got this now - I guess that was KnowLate!

And there is no prize for guessing which cold, dark forks emitted these 
two plaints:

 From Whiny Dwarf:
> Fix your mail server! just a bit late!

And Angry Dwarf:
> God DAAAAAMMMMMNNNNN IIIIITTT! I didn't see your message until now! 
> Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

> We would have been there if I had seen the message before. Kuso! (as 
> the Japanese would say).
>
> Fuck.
> Fuck.
> Fuck.
> Fuck.
> Fuck.
> Fuck.

Perhaps I should remind the latter gently that it was not in any way his 
fault. The universe *was* out to get him!

And finally, here's an object lesson for all ye of little faith to learn 
from my sins:

> SpamAssassin rated it spam (barely). Gotta stop

Yes, boys and girls, Mr. Assassin, like Mr. Lott, gets very annoyed if 
you call the Great American Shrine a... ""boob tube""

PS. This is the obscure footnote where I actually hide the bits in this 
post. What we just encountered here is that an event-processing system 
with a 10-day RTT cannot be used to reliably handle events more often 
than once every 20 days. That's why I waited to reply. six bonus points 
to anyone who can prove this hunch of mine. Hint: try analyzing the 
problem in frequency-domain.

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view

Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!

My breasts have been halved, breaded and shipped to their current
resting-place on a shelf in a supermarket in Denver. My legs should be
arriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are
now being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas. My blood and bones have been
rendered for cat food, fertilizer and who-knows- what else. My wings have
been seasoned with barbecue sauce and served with a side of ranch dressing
and celery at some bar and grill in New York City. My feet? Well, they're
headed to Asia where I'm told they're something of a delicacy.

So, a couple of things intrigued me about this byline, and its associated

And On the 47th Day, This Chicken Went to Market

- I had no idea how much computer controls played into the raising of
livestock
- I had no idea how fast a chicken is raised these days

It also strikes me that it will not be very long before livestock is
genetically engineered to be dumber and meatier, and better adapted to
living in industrial conditions.

Well, IMNHO, its because companies do not reward knowledge sharers. When 
time comes for evaluation, there isn't a line on the page saying ""Helped 
others to succeed with their projects."" Sharing inevitably cuts into the 
time for personal productive work, and generally shows up as a red flag 
if your boss has a ""management by exception""(1) style.

The prospect of expansion so rapid that the night sky empties out because other galaxies are simply *outside* our light cone -- ??!? -- is really chilling.

In the Beginning ...

July 23, 2002
By DENNIS OVERBYE 




 

It has always been easy to make fun of cosmologists,
confined to a dust mote lost in space, pronouncing judgment
on the fate of the universe or the behavior of galaxies
billions of light-years away, with only a few scraps of
light as evidence. 

""Cosmologists are often wrong,"" the Russian physicist Lev
Landau put it, ""but never in doubt."" 

For most of the 20th century, cosmology seemed less a
science than a religious war over, say, whether the
universe had a beginning, in a fiery Big Bang billions of
years ago, or whether it exists eternally in the so-called
Steady State. 



In the last few years, however, a funny thing has happened.
Cosmologists are beginning to agree with one another.
Blessed with new instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope and other space-based observatories, a new
generation of their giant cousins on the ground and
ever-faster computer networks, cosmology is entering ""a
golden age"" in which data are finally outrunning
speculation. 

""The rate at which we are learning and discovering new
things is just extraordinary,"" said Dr. Charles Bennett, an
astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md. 

As a result, cosmologists are beginning to converge on what
they call a ""standard model"" of the universe that is
towering in its ambition. It purports to trace, at least in
broad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after
time began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy
and subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,
stars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark
future in which all of these will have died. 

The universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion
years ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains
resides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,
perhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial
explosion and not yet identified. 

Within these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the
sky that have defined creation for generations of humans
are swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good
case can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe
will go on expanding forever. 

In fact, recent observations have suggested that the
expansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,
under the influence of a ""dark energy"" even more mysterious
than dark matter. 

Recently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William
Percival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from
a variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest
theoretical model, what they say is the most precise
enumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have
been fighting about for all these decades. 

The universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,
plus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it
is made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and
unknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.
The rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark
energy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 

It is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,
satisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the
universe should be designed. Continued agreement with
coming experiments may mean that science is approaching the
end of a ""great program"" of cosmological tests that began
in the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.
Bharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft
of a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. 

In other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a
road map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at
the University of California at Berkeley, called it ""a
universe chock full of exotics that don't make sense to
anybody."" 

Moreover there are some questions that scientists still do
not know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was
there anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for
life in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than
nothing at all? Will we ever know? 

""We know much, but we still understand very little,"" said
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of
Chicago. 

The Big Question 

Expanding Forever, 
Or Big Crunch? 

The dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of
Stonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines
all testify to the need to explain the world and existence.
This quest took its present form in 1917. That was when
Albert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,
which explained how matter and energy warp space-time to
produce gravity, and applied it to the universe. 

Einstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described
it would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own
gravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe
was stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called
the cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a
long-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. 

In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the
universe was expanding. The sky was full of distant
galaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if
propelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle
later called derisively a ""big bang."" The universe was not
stable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.
Einstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his
biggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,
and the universe. 

Hoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis
became orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.
Robert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,
discovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the
sky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of
the primordial fireball itself. 

Relieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing
Einstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the
Carnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology
""the search for two numbers"" - one, the Hubble constant,
telling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other
telling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether
the universe will expand forever or not. 

The second number, known as the deceleration parameter,
indicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the
density of its contents. In a high-density universe, space
would be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a
universe would eventually stop expanding and fall back
together in a big crunch that would extinguish space and
time, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.
A low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an
opposite or ""open"" curvature like a saddle, harder to
envision, and would expand forever. 

In between with no overall warpage at all was a
""Goldilocks"" universe with just the right density to expand
forever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite
time it would coast to a stop. This was a ""flat"" universe
in the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the
simplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.


But the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even
with the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar
Mountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which
had been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of
measuring shadows and searching ""among ghostly errors of
measurement for landmarks that are scarcely more
substantial."" 

The Dark Side 

Invisible Matter 
Molds Galaxies 


It was not till the mid-70's, a
quarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,
that groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion
that the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and
galaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph
to stop the cosmic expansion. 

""So the universe will continue to expand forever and
galaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things
will just die,"" Dr. Sandage said at the time. 

But the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there
was a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.
The stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the
gravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter
- ""missing matter"" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky
labeled it in the 1930's. 

Many galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they
would fly apart unless they were being reined in by the
gravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering
observations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements
indicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible
galaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be
even more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough
to stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some
theorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of
the sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. 

But what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or
dark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists
speculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over
from the Big Bang. 

Many varieties of these particles are predicted by theories
of high-energy physics. But their existence has not been
confirmed or detected in particle accelerators. 

""We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the
universe,"" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and
Nobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. 

Collectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting
massive particles, such particles would not respond to
electromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus
would be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would
also be relatively slow-moving, or ""cold"" in physics
jargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. 

As Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter
cloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles
would shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,
like moonlight through a window. 

But the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists
say, would shape the cosmos and its contents. 

Gathering along the fault lines laid down by random
perturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter
would congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000
Suns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would
cool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as
stars. 

The clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a
series of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds
would assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then
assemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,
and so forth. 

Using the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -
light travels at a finite speed, so the farther out
astronomers look the farther back in time they see -
cosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did
assemble itself from the ""bottom up,"" as the dark matter
model predicts. 

Last year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the
first stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath
of the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million
years old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the
universe was a half to a quarter its present age,
cosmologists say. 

""The big news in the last decade is that even half a
universe ago the universe looked pretty different,"" said
Dr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,
with no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that
decorate the sky today. 

We would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we
could see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he
said. 

""By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,""
said Dr. Dressler. 

Yet there are still many questions that the cold dark
matter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not
know, for example, how the first stars formed or why the
models of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the
cores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter
particles themselves been unambiguously detected or
identified, despite continuing experiments. 

Some astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from
the inability of simple mathematical models to deal with
messy details of the real world. 

""It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,"" Dr. Richard
Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics
said. ""We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to
solve them back then."" 

But others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the
Weizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying
the gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in
the first place would alleviate the need for dark matter
altogether. 

The Bang's Fuel 

Inflating One Ounce 
To a Whole Universe 


Clues to what had actually exploded
in the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another
great scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called
theory of everything that would unite all physical
phenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines
powerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on
Earth, some theorists turned to the sky. 

""The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,"" Dr.
Jakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. 

Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
today - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak
nuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from
particle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those
are simply different manifestations of a single unified
force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
moments. 

As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was
a fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with
one force after another ""freezing out,"" or splitting away. 

In 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this
process would have had drastic consequences for the
universe. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can
stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
freeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,
the universe could ""supercool"" and stay in a unified state
too long. In that case, space itself would become
temporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,
or energy. 

Inserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would
act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
itself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.


In far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck
much smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size
of a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately
expansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,
resulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky
and stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the
magical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about
an ounce of primordial stuff. 

""The universe,"" Dr. Guth liked to say, ""might be the
ultimate free lunch."" 

Dr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.
Guth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as
""the dynamite behind the Big Bang."" 

As modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at
Stanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and
Dr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at
Davis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever
since. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that
inflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main
citizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the
paradoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic
affairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum
theory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little
bits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,
so-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in
the early universe. These would serve as the gravitational
seeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. 

As a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with
the idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to
test their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,
they have no precise theory about what might have actually
caused it. ""Inflation is actually a class of theories,""
said Dr. Guth. 

In the latest version, called ""chaotic inflation,"" Dr.
Linde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of
theorized force fields could have done the trick. 

Indeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation
can occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of
universes out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. 

""The universe inflates on top of itself,"" Dr. Linde told a
physics conference this spring in Princeton. ""It's
happening right now."" 

The Golden Age 

New Devices Detect 
Primordial Glow 
If the inflationary
theorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion
light-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster
universe, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of
our view. 

According to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of
the cosmos should appear geometrically ""flat,"" the way a
section of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This
was the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and
simple. 

But it required, by the logic of Einstein's general
relativity, that there be much more dark matter, or
something, to the universe, enough to ""flatten"" space-time,
than astronomers had found. 

In fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with
other observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that
by 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that
the entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the
universe and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the
Big Bang itself, might have to be junked. 

So it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted
the announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in
discerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio
glow. 

These were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large
cosmic structures would eventually grow. 

""If you're religious, it's like seeing God,"" said Dr.
George Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory who led the COBE team. 

Astronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic
ideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic
data, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments
went into operation. 

A year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble
telescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation
has come in for particular scrutiny from new radio
telescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The
news has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. 

For three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution
observations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches
stippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is
consistent with the predictions from inflation and cold
dark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small
enough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of
galaxies. 

""I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,""
Dr. Guth said. ""The signal was so weak it wasn't even
detected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations
of one part in 100,000."" 

Perhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations
indicates that the universe has a ""flat"" geometry, as
predicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although
observations could not prove that inflation was right, a
nonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and
to cosmological orthodoxy. 

""Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the
earliest moments of creation, passed its first very
important test,"" Dr. Turner said at the time. 

The most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at
least in the near future, are generally expected to come
late this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or
MAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on
June 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space
Agency's Planck satellite, in 2006. 

It is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to
detect what Dr. Turner calls ""the smoking gun signature of
inflation."" The violent stretching of the universe should
roil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that
would leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. 

Detecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but
also might help scientists establish what caused the
inflation in the first place, giving science its first look
at the strange physics that prevailed when creation was
only about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a second old. 

The Universe's Fate 

Bleak Implications 
Of `Dark Energy' 

In 1998, two competing teams of
astronomers startled the scientific world with the news
that the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up
under the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems
embedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent
of Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological
constant. 

""Dark energy,"" the phenomenon was quickly named. 

If dark
energy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies
will eventually speed away from one another so quickly that
they couldn't see one another. The universe would become
cold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away
the energy needed for life and thought. 

It would be ""the worst possible universe,"" for the quality
and quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist
at Case Western Reserve University. 

Dr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, called the discovery of dark energy ""the
strangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.""


The discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.
Neither team had expected to find the universe
accelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much
the expansion of the universe was slowing because of the
gravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its
fate. 

One team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
Lawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers
led by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia. 

Each group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,
including the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor
certain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.
Such explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are
powerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when
the universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.


Leapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,
propitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same
answer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;
it was speeding up. 

Dr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,
conceded, ""With only one group, it would have been a lot
harder to get the community to buy into such a surprising
result."" 

""This was a very strange result,"" said Dr. Adam Riess, a
member of Dr. Schmidt's team. ""It was the opposite of what
we thought we were doing."" 

The results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant
to the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the
constant had never really gone away and had in fact been
given new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously
rejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.


But it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. 

According to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum
theory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with
the energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed
in and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called
vacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old
cosmological constant, or attract. 

The case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,
when the cosmic background observations reported evidence
of a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to
find only about a third as much matter, both dark and
luminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat
geometry, something else had to be adding to it. 

The discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's
view of the universe as the poor man's particle
accelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,
somewhat to the pride of the astronomers. 

""A coming of age of astronomy,"" Dr. Dressler called it.


What is dark energy? The question now hangs over the
universe. 

Is it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt
his children? In that case, as the universe expands and the
volume of space increases, astronomers say, the push
because of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the
galaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading
to a dire dark future. 

Other physicists, however, have pointed out that the
theories of modern physics are replete with mysterious
force fields, collectively called ""quintessence,"" that
might or might not exist, but that could temporarily
produce negative gravity and mimic the action of a
cosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future
are off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,
or vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. 

A third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at
all, in which case not just the future, but the whole
carefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be
in doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be
mimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far
universe or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics
of supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups
are joining the original two teams in the hunt for new
supernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark
energy on the history of the universe. 

Dr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite
telescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate
exactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration
kicked in. 

The Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, 
But Hardly Complete 
For all the new answers being
harvested, some old questions linger, and they have now
been joined by new ones. 

A flat universe is the most mathematically appealing
solution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But
they are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of
dark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.
Turner called it ""a preposterous universe."" 

But Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,
said that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the
universe and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is
fundamental. Some features of the universe that are now
considered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark
matter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may
turn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of
the many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. 

""If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were
many big bangs or one,"" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these
and other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await
the final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles
Einstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the
universe, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. 

Such a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the
first few moments of the universe, when it was so small
that even space and time should become fuzzy and
discontinuous. 

For two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for
quantum gravity on string theory, which posits that
elementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or
11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,
corresponds to a different note on the string. 

In principle, string theory can explain all the forces of
nature. But even its adherents concede that their equations
are just approximations to an unknown theory that they call
M-theory, with ""M"" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or
even mother, as in ""mother of all theories."" Moreover, the
effects of ""stringy physics"" are only evident at energies
forever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. 

Some string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,
to discover some effect that would show up in the poor
man's particle accelerator, the sky. 

In addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,
or ""branes,"" of various dimensions. Our universe can be
envisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional
space like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane
universes nearby. These branes could interact
gravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. 

In one version suggested last year by four cosmologists
led by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would
repeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth
through each other, causing our universe to undergo an
eternal chain of big bangs. 

Such notions are probably the future for those who are paid
to wonder about the universe. 

And the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to
reconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of
Princeton, who has often acted as the conscience of the
cosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish
trends. 

He wonders whether the situation today can be compared to
another historical era, around 1900, when many people
thought that physics was essentially finished and when the
English physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of
""clouds"" remained to be dealt with. 

""A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity
and quantum theory,"" the twin revolutions of 20th-century
science, Dr. Peebles said. 

Likewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called
""the dark sector,"" which could have more complicated
physics than cosmologists think. 

""I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep
as relativity and quantum mechanics,"" Dr. Peebles said.
""I'm not arguing that they won't."" 

As for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm
answer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's protg and has
seen it all. 

""It's like asking, `Does God exist?' "" he said.


Predicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that
simple mathematical models really work to describe the
universe. 

""I don't think we really know how things work,"" he said.


Although Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the
emerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be
alive. 

""It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we
could have imagined 100 years ago,"" he said. ""I think this
is the most exciting life I could have had.""

Axelrod, eh? ""the E.coli of social psychology""? Nice to see our old friend still going strong -- Prisoner's Dilemma is old enough to qualify for AARP membership!

Regarding experimental design, it is interesting that 1) they used an all-female panel and 2) they included a mix of ages, from 20-60 and 3) they used humans, confederates, computers as well as imitations.

Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to Cooperate

July 23, 2002
By NATALIE ANGIER 




 

What feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in
the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the
Securities and Exchange Commission? 

Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious
greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered
that the small, brave act of cooperating with another
person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over
selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy. 

Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a
classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in
which participants can select from a number of greedy or
cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain,
researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over
""me-ism,"" the mental circuitry normally associated with
reward-seeking behavior swelled to life. 

And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy,
the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of
pleasure. 

The researchers, performing their work at Emory University
in Atlanta, used magnetic resonance imaging to take what
might be called portraits of the brain on hugs. 

""The results were really surprising to us,"" said Dr.
Gregory S. Berns, a psychiatrist and an author on the new
report, which appears in the current issue of the journal
Neuron. ""We went in expecting the opposite."" 

The researchers had thought that the biggest response would
occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other
defected, when the cooperator might feel that she was being
treated unjustly. 

Instead, the brightest signals arose in cooperative
alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already
known to respond to desserts, pictures of pretty faces,
money, cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights.


""It's reassuring,"" Dr. Berns said. ""In some ways, it says
that we're wired to cooperate with each other."" 

The study is among the first to use M.R.I. technology to
examine social interactions in real time, as opposed to
taking brain images while subjects stared at static
pictures or thought-prescribed thoughts. 

It is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient
conundrum, why are humans so, well, nice? Why are they
willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and
to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high
percentage of the time? 

Scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of
competitive behavior. But the depth and breadth of human
altruism, the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain
for the long-term common good, far exceeds behaviors seen
even in other large-brained highly social species like
chimpanzees and dolphins, and it has as such been difficult
to understand. 

""I've pointed out to my students how impressive it is that
you can take a group of young men and women of prime
reproductive age, have them come into a classroom, sit down
and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other,"" said
Dr. Peter J. Richerson, a professor of environmental
science and policy at the University of California at Davis
and an influential theorist in the field of cultural
evolution. ""If you put 50 male and 50 female chimpanzees
that don't know each other into a lecture hall, it would be
a social explosion."" 

Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and colleagues
recently presented findings on the importance of punishment
in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the
willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or
violate norms, even when the chastisers take risks and gain
nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police. 

In her survey of the management of so-called commons in
small-scale communities where villagers have the right, for
example, to graze livestock on commonly held land, Dr.
Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University found that all
communities have some form of monitoring to gird against
cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource. 

In laboratory games that mimic small-scale commons, Dr.
Richerson said, 20 to 30 percent have to be coerced by a
threat of punishment to cooperate. 

Fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative
behavior to the degree observed among humans. If research
like Dr. Fehr's shows the stick side of the equation, the
newest findings present the neural carrot - people
cooperate because it feels good to do it. 

In the new findings, the researchers studied 36 women from
20 to 60 years old, many of them students at Emory and
inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards.
The scientists chose an all-female sample because so few
brain-imaging studies have looked at only women. Most have
been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women. 

But there is a vast body of non- imaging data that rely on
using the Prisoner's Dilemma. 

""It's a simple and elegant model for reciprocity,"" said Dr.
James K. Rilling, an author on the Neuron paper who is at
Princeton. ""It's been referred to as the E. coli of social
psychology."" 

>>From past results, the researchers said, one can assume
that neuro- imaging studies of men playing the game would
be similar to their new findings with women. 

The basic structure of the trial had two women meet each
other briefly ahead of time. One was placed in the scanner
while the other remained outside the scanning room. The two
interacted by computer, playing about 20 rounds of the
game. In every round, each player pressed a button to
indicate whether she would ""cooperate"" or ""defect."" Her
answer would be shown on-screen to the other player. 

The monetary awards were apportioned after each round. If
one player defected and the other cooperated, the defector
earned $3 and the cooperator nothing. If both chose to
cooperate, each earned $2. If both opted to defect, each
earned $1. 

Hence, mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far
more profitable strategy, at $40 a woman, than complete
mutual defection, which gave each $20. 

The risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for
a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would
fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer. 

In some cases, both women were allowed to pursue any
strategy that they chose. In other cases, the non- scanned
woman would be a ""confederate"" with the researchers,
instructed, unbeknown to the scanned subject, to defect
after three consecutive rounds of cooperation, the better
to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike
and gritty. 

In still other experiments, the woman in the scanner played
a computer and knew that her partner was a machine. In
other tests, women played a computer but thought that it
was a human. 

The researchers found that as a rule the freely
strategizing women cooperated. Even occasional episodes of
defection, whether from free strategizers or confederates,
were not necessarily fatal to an alliance. 

""The social bond could be reattained easily if the defector
chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds,"" another
author of the report, Dr. Clinton D. Kilts, said, ""although
the one who had originally been `betrayed' might be wary
from then on."" 

As a result of the episodic defections, the average
per-experiment take for the participants was in the $30's.
""Some pairs, though, got locked into mutual defection,"" Dr.
Rilling said. 

Analyzing the scans, the researchers found that in rounds
of cooperation, two broad areas of the brain were
activated, both rich in neurons able to respond to
dopamine, the brain chemical famed for its role in
addictive behaviors. 

One is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the
brain right above the spinal cord. Experiments with rats
have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum,
the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the
electrodes, apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback
that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing
the bar. 

Another region activated during cooperation was the
orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes. In
addition to being part of the reward-processing system, Dr.
Rilling said, it is also involved in impulse control. 

""Every round, you're confronted with the possibility of
getting an extra dollar by defecting,"" he said. ""The choice
to cooperate requires impulse control."" 

Significantly, the reward circuitry of the women was
considerably less responsive when they knew that they were
playing against a computer. The thought of a human bond,
but not mere monetary gain, was the source of contentment
on display. 

In concert with the imaging results, the women, when asked
afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games,
often described feeling good when they cooperated and
expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their
playing partners. 

Assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent
innate among humans and reinforced by the brain's feel-good
circuitry, the question of why it arose remains unclear.
Anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for
humanity's ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult
plant foods or rear difficult children. So the capacity to
cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears. 

Yet as with any other trait, the willingness to abide by
the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and
steal from one's neighbors is not uniformly distributed. 

""If we put some C.E.O.'s in here, I'd like to see how they
respond,"" Dr. Kilts said. ""Maybe they wouldn't find a
positive social interaction rewarding at all."" 

A Prisoner's Dilemma indeed.

I have a version that's working now. I'll try it a couple of days and 
check it during daylight. Basically I added an agument to 
ClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I 
also flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after 
the Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages 
Unread. I'll check that tomorrow.

G'night.

I just use Mozilla, and don't have to think about ignoring toolbar ads

I notice Opera tends to ignore my advertisement preferences, so this is

does, minus the obnoxious ad slime, so why use use Opera then?

more than cool --->

quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these

implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
think.

adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
efx.

content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.

display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?

misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.

ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..

You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,

I'm not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution
for countries in real difficulty.  See Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel for
Economics) on the FMI's failed remedies.  Of course googling on
""Stiglitz FMI"" only brings up links in Spanish and French.  I guess
that variety of spin is non grata in many anglo circles.

Telecom regulations are an example of implemented Libertarianism?

And for how screwed up North America's telecom industries and
regulators are, they're better than much of the rest of the
world, where it doesn't just ""take a year or more"" to get
started: it's impossible/illegal.

We can lose billions of dollars, and have hundreds of thousands of 
people laid off... and after it all, our diets, health, longevity, 
and freedom to pursue activities of our own choosing are still the 
envy of billions of people. 

Would you rather be unemployed, broke, and in possession of career

I attribute this apparently precipitous decline in ""sustainable"" development to the twin evils of increasing personal freedom and economic globalization. Somebody oughta pass a law to prevent those things, of course, before it's too late. The People's way of life *must* be preserved in its natural, pre-industrial state, or we'll lose it forever. ;-). Cheers, RAH http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/science/earth/20POPU.html?pagewanted=print&position=top The New York Times August 20, 2002 Experts Scale Back Estimates of World Population Growth By BARBARA CROSSETTE Demography has never been an exact science. Ever since social thinkers began trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago, the people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding projections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch birthrates plunge in ways they never expected. Only a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and education for women were necessary precursors for declines in population growth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest countries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster than predicted toward the replacement level - 2.1 children for the average mother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for unexpected deaths in the overall population. A few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico fertility rates were as high as five or six. As a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's population would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are scaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's population will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining. Some experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population Council, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John Bongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the last half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines begin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good family planning services are not widely available. Sharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries had already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would thwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose big families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than anywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer children are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family planning. ""Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul,"" said Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ""Demographers have been surprised by just about every big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't anticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in fertility in industrialized Western democracies."" What's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and some trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the 20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the world's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By 2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53 percent still in the countryside. Between now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about eight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations' population division. ""Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many other activities,"" Dr. Chamie said. ""You're getting people concentrated, so you can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The Indian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets educational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political participation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations campaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning."" As births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting older. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing. But not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life expectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In South Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut that to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In Botswana, it is 36 years, down from 70. Another cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are continuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely to cope with the results, including strains on natural resources - farmland, water, air, forests and animals. Last year, the organization published a report and wall chart, ""Population, Environment and Development,"" plotting and analyzing population changes as its contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting. The United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2 billion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing some 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in less-developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United Nations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will dominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Thus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like India, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to rise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people annually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says. India is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by 2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now the norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of the people of India by many measures. Among industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate comparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth, Dr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In Europe, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration. With much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center in Honolulu has just published a report, ""The Future of Population in Asia,"" which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a region where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the report notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31 percent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less than $1 a day. ""Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any region in the world,"" the report says, adding that expansion of farmland has been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant loss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of the world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report predicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any other region. ""When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia,"" the report concludes, ""the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed, transported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an issue that cannot be ignored."" --  ----------------- R.

Oh.  OK.
 
These results don't help break EC crypto at all.
 
With RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the
cryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential
algorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the
very least (record = 524 bits).
 
With EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret
discrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a
discrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential
(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).
 
Up until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One
choice is a few curves with special properties that originally were
chosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto
operations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on
curves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other
choice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this
a few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST
standardized those curves.
 
What changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves
on an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with
small curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.
Now even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.
 
This means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can
distribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some
stage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself
secret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to
compute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine
wanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...
 
So basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this
makes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,
encoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.

I didn't mind the ads. The problem is that the ad

time it goes to change the ad, it thrashes my

the ad, but I do mind that serving ads cripples

Alas, Mozilla is also a PIG. So I'm back to using

I've just checked in a rather large patch which replaces the Unseen Window 
with a new Sequences Window.

Since the preference items are different, you'll need to turn the display of 
the sequences window on in the preferences even if you had the unseen window 
enabled.  I couldn't figure out how to default the preferences to match the 
unseen window.

I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are purely 
cosmetic changes.

For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to display 
the other sequences.  Preferences allow you to say if you want a given 
sequence display to never show or to always show.

I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
week or so ago.

The two things that I know I need to do are to fix the performance issue that 
I think is what Anders was seeing yesterday and to catch the documentation up 
with the code.

My wife is out for an ""evening with the girls"" tonight, so I should be able to 
work on the performance issue tonight and check it in after some testing in a 
day or two.

I hope I didn't break very much with all the changes I made...

My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj""

like India's has.

But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so.  He hasn't
dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru,
Philippines, and Egypt.  In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it
was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company.  In the
Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.  In Egypt, about 80%
of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially
illegal.

India hasn't been helped by its socialism.  Socialism has certainly
helped strangle the country in permits.  But perhaps De Soto is right
that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the
legal, official property system.

Putting most of the people in the property system was something the west
only finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago.  It wasn't
easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it.

well, it changes the time then, and then leaves it alone.

However, Windows expects the time in the RTC to be local time. Linux
can be configured to do either this, or to have the RTC at UTC,
and then use /etc/localtime to figure out the right timezone.

Depending on how you've set it up, this may be a problem (with one
or other of the OS's one hour out). OS-X also does this silliness :(

(RTC should always have UTC, that way different people can set their
own timezone on the machine... though I suppose that only applies
to multi-user machines).

If the situation in Egypt is anything
like the situation in the Philippines,
it's because people (due to a strange
desire for jobs) squat on land which
they don't own.*

For people to be able to buy their own
land, capitalism must be healthy, but
not triumphant; there need to be too
many capitalists, not too few.

(how well off were the major landowners
in india before independence?)

-Dave

* In the US, we are not so friendly to
our capitalists: adverse possession is
only supposed to take 5 years.

(How much do we owe to our frontiers?
Heck, in Egypt didn't they pretty much
invent geometry a few millenia ago to
keep track of their property lines?)

 Hmm. Yeah, mutt sorta calls the sendmail program directly. But I thought
it would be very crap if the auth details (username, password) had to be
hardcoded into the sendmail.cf (and damned if I can work out how to do
that anyway).

Mutt interacts with smtpdaemon or something like that doesn't it?

Can mutt interact directly with SMTP server with authentication
capabilities? I don't think it can. 

Surely you can just run a mailserver on your own machine and send
mail using it?

Some logs might be of some help.

1) some output of /var/log/maillog with some relevant error message
(that could be /var/log/mail.log or some other log depending on your
configuration)

2) the output from ``postconf -n''

On another note, you did recreate the mailboxes, didn't you?

Remember that the GA is going to be considering combinatorial 
uses of the rules, so rules which look dodgy on their own might 
be gems for the GA -- perhaps something with a S/O ratio of .5 
actually occurs often in combination with some other rule, and 
in those situations, helps to distinguish spam vs nonspam.

Hi

I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.

The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.

If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.

Thanks

Mark

Hi All,

Just wondering if anyone has ever installed StarOffice

I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5

I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is
unresolved!!!!

Thanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the
External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get
that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is
not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than
enough for 1 PC ).

It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more
difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!! Any last gasp ideas
would be welcome

I found out that my firewall box has a dodgy USB and so I'm awaiting a

and forgot. I've bought Smoothwall Corporate edition as its the best
firewall/routing solution around or so I've been led to believe.

Hi all,
	I am seriously thinking of getting the ADSL ""solo"" connection
from Eircom. I also have more than one computer therefore I need a router
so that I can connect them together.
The 2 options I am looking at are : 
  the ADSL usb modem connected to my linux machine, with the linux
	machine acting as firewall; and
  a combined router / firewall box which would be connected directly
	to the ADSL modem.

So my questions are : 
	what recommendations would any of you have about the above ?
	do I need to have NAT (I have only a vague idea of what this does )?
	what other options should I be looking at ?

Thanks
Con

A detachable clip-on eyepiece display could be arbitrarily high-res. Now
that we see first OLED prototypes (cheap, can be printed on curved
surfaces resulting in cheaper optics) it can't be more than 5 years off.

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?

With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

the human, sub-human, or machine starts speaking, why not have a box that 
just hangs up for me?  Maybe it could blow a police whistle (play a

Michael's Minute: Do the Math...Dispel the Myths  A reporter came by the Lindows.com   offices last Friday. He told me that he wanted to try and use  LindowsOS to write a story, but he didn't think it was possible because his office used Microsoft Word .doc files. I asked him to have a seat and watch.   I turned on the Walmart.com  computer and then clicked on the running man   which took me to the Click-N-Run Warehouse   where I installed OpenOffice   using Click-N-Run. I then clicked the ""Run It""  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer. I then typed ""Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save hundreds using LindowsOS."" I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word."" The reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters, he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to overcome a couple of myths.  The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That may have been true in the past, but we've annihilated this myth with the latest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5 minutes. It's point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating system (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at  .   The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the graphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist. Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps over the last couple of years, but they've gotten quite good at reading and writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these products is via the Click-N-Run   Warehouse.  Here's a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in the Warehouse  all downloaded and installed with a single click: OpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and swap them with Microsoft counterparts.  Programs included are: OpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs)  OpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel)  OpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint) OpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program Click here   for a great tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice. GIMP  If you are familiar with Adobe's Photoshop, you'll want to Click-N-Run GIMP. It's a powerful image editor.    Evolution  For those used to Microsoft's Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home. Check out how easy it is to use  . Flowchart Pro, which is similar to Microsoft's Visio, is a  rich charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and organizational charts, plus more. See how easy it for yourself, visit Flowchart Pro at  This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the Warehouse  that make Linux a practical choice for the desktop today. And if you're still not convinced, then do the math.   For  a total cost of $499  , including all  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete system.  With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped systems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars stretched much further running LindowsOS.  Michael Robertson Please visit   to answers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!  LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

The 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies. But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk. Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago. It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who launched it in July. Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table. At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem. The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby. One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It caused great amusement."" The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200. A Virgin spokeswoman said: ""Those determined to join the Mile High Club will do so despite the lack of comforts. ""We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something that we would encourage because of air regulations."" The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan ""Mine is bigger than yours"". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far East and the US.";1;0

Except that parroting the party line doesn't really require much
freedom of speech. Now if you had posted something from a left of

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush Views

Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01

The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing

Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.

Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security. This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. 

Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.

Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.

""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""

Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrust Web access
management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.

The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.

""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""

About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
inter- and intra-enterprise
collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
collaboration very rapidly and
affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
by effectively transforming
unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
the use of such features as
cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
for mobile professionals.

About RSA Security, Inc.
RSA Security Inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations
for e-business through its RSA
SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon
digital certificate
management product families. With approximately one billion RSA BSAFE-enabled applications in use worldwide,
more than ten million RSA
SecurID authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, RSA Security has the proven
leadership and innovative technology to

This was not a very busy week, with people packing for YAPC::Europe, and
all that... Nevertheless, the smoke tests were running, the bug reports
were flying, and an appropriate amount of patches were sent. Read about
printf formats, serialized tied thingies, built-in leak testing, syntax
oddities, et alii.

It occurs at the very end of an excellent article which I recommend to you. In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the following: ""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen."" Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable"" for publication at the time it was written. #  distributed via : no commercial use without permission #   is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, #  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets #  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and ""info nettime-l"" in the msg body #  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net --- end forwarded text --  ----------------- R.

**Techs slump with Intel**  
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings
announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.

Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan
and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index
slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq
composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.

Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar
helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0
points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing
session. The S&P; 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another
multi-year low.

**Microsoft reveals media XP details**  
Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows
XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which
will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs
and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With
Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to
catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's No. 5 wireless telephone company, on

**Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a
""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02**  
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is
building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than
traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes
Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply
products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power
supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't
need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large,
untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee
suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely
to rise much in the short term.

**French TV exec says Vivendi tapped him for CFO**  
A French television executive said on Tuesday he had been approached about
taking over as finance chief at beleaguered media giant Vivendi Universal --
and acknowledged the job would be a ""challenge."" Jacques Espinasse, chief
operating officer at French satellite TV consortium TPS, has been cited by the
French press as a candidate for the financial hot seat at Vivendi, which is
grappling with cash and debt problems in the wake of the sacking earlier this
month of chairman Jean-Marie Messier.

You're a good bunch, you Penguins.

Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you
a quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik
has found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But,
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little
callous about the 'Net ...

Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing
part of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can
further put our technical skills (be they Linux _or_ Windows skills) to work
for a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort,
based in the Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services
to worthwhile charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly
describes our purpose. Next, we need volunteers with the time and ability to
lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe
the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain can
use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.

I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the
Aicardi Syndrome Foundation. Though I don't currently know their technical
needs, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read ""research and technical
dollars are minimal."" I'm sure we can, as a group, provide them a way to fill
existing technical holes.

That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make
others.

Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging
program, GeekLog to pull together a community project area where interested
parties can gather, coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become.
I'll keep you posted on the details.

In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their
protection from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into
the water, all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the
community.

Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

**Quick Shortcuts**

Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in
shortcuts you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to
change your system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips
that are quick and very easy to learn and remember.

Got a cluttered console screen? Use **[ctrl]+l** to clear it. This does the
same thing as the **clear** command with far fewer keystrokes.

Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the **[ctrl+d** key
combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal
window, as well.

To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's
substantial.

Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

**Kernel Configuration - Part XI**

We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel
configuration series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss
configuring block devices in your kernel.

We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of
data ""blocks."" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of
data to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly.
Data intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your
power dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating
data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.

Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer _then_
committing the data.

The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining
why they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to
store or retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of
the disc surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know
where there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the
disc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related
data together.

Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and
forget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and
physical. The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm
Pilot. The storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a
physical storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive
and account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also
send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an
indication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as
well.

So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a
predetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical
properties of the hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest
level view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical
data storage really is.

In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data
storage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about
your existing hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you
using? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the
drive located - on the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because
the variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock
configuration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. I can
tell you this - you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a
floppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can.
Find out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the
configuration process will be relatively painless.

A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series
continues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration
recommendations where possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make
such recommendations. However, where the variable set is as broad as block
devices, much of the legwork will be up to you.

Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.

**rxLinux**

  
http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/

""The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of
multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web
interface is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers.
Servers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is
completely independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot.""

Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, I haven't been by
their website in quite some time, so when Hal Goldstein informed me of a new
electronic delivery method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it
a spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the Digital Edition and
see if you like reading the mag in that format better than the print variety.
A Software and Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my last
belated visit.

I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but not for data. It's
found a more frequent home on my belt as an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad
gave us a bicycle. Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable,
and it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the Compaq iPaq 3870
and HP Jornada 565, and have been more pleased with the audio ability of the
iPaq, due in part to the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and
bass levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my opinion.

**LDAP Whodunit**  
Pondered by Warren Dugas

""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important
it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come
from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did
Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""

History of LDAP

http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp

X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a comprehensive Directory Service,
including an information model, namespace, functional model, and
authentication framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full OSI protocol that
contains extensive functionality, much of which is not used by most
applications.

DAP is significantly more complicated than the more prevalent TCP/IP stack
implementations and requires more code and computing horsepower to run. The
size and complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, such as
the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality often comes with the machine.
DAP stack implementations are cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the
acceptance of X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, with
help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed a protocol that would
work over TCP/IP and was small enough when implemented to run on a thin client
like PC's running the Windows operating system or the Macintosh.

The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March of 1994. The LDAP
version 2 Specification was published as rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and
Indexing of Directories (ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In
April of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and Novell
separately announced support for LDAP protocol in their Directory Services
products in order that they may in turn operate with each other and integrate
with the Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts but at
this time is not finished.

**Looking for Sound**  
Suggested by Corey Hollett

http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp  
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html

_""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best sound card and speaker set
combination for 5.1 sound. My criteria were that it be excellent for games,
music, and dvd playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong point.""_

Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two respects. Creative
has long maintained a healthy share of the sound card market with a solid name
and decent products. Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards and at attractive
price points. Corey decided on the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card, a great
choice.

His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings on the subject. I own
two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 2.400 and most recently the ProMedia
5.1. The 2.400 system was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the dust. The above
review that Corey pointed out hits the high points, and is actually quite in-
depth for an ""initial"" review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write
up a more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

**QuickTime 6 Released**

http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/

With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the licensing haggles over
MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4
isn't the only addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 5 support and
better AppleScript functionality also tag along. As always, there is a
standard free version available for download, but the Pro edition adds
additional features, such as full screen video playback, the ability to create
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free player.

**Microtel & WalMart Love Linux**

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html

WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. They were one of the
first manufacturers to preinstall LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail
market through WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give potential Linux
users an easier way to get started without having to build their own system
from scratch or deal with driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall
cost. A Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little as $648
with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

**Microsoft stresses security for Exchange**  
Microsoft is readying a new Exchange Server e-mail system, with improved
security, a facelift for Outlook, and better support for cell phones and other
handhelds. The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the
product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default
**disable certain messaging features** to prevent hackers and virus makers
from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the
e-mail and messaging market is **Lotus** , the company also competes against
**Novell** and newcomer **Oracle** , which plans to release its own e-mail and
messaging software later this year.  
![](http://www.zdnet.com/techupdate/i/arrow_blue.gif) **Read the full story**

**IBM puts more bite in 'Shark'**  
Can IBM's release of a new top-end ""Shark"" **enterprise storage system** boost
the company's prospects in the depressed storage market? Big Blue has fixed
many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer
capabilities to cache size, and adding **RAID 10 support** and Eliza self-
healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant **EMC** , which last week
lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and **Hitachi** , which
still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark
sales with related server and service deals.

**Report: Linux hack attacks on the rise**  
Hackers are increasingly targeting Linux-based Web servers, while the number
of successful attacks on **Windows** systems has decreased, according to a new
report. Linux server applications are often vulnerable to attack because of
**mismanagement** , according to the study, which urges Linux system
administrators to be more vigilant about patching known security bugs.

**Frethem worm variant: ""Re: Your password!""**  
An e-mail message that promises to reveal **secret information** with a
password is a variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k (aka
w32.frethem.k@mm) is a more robust version of Frethem.e, which uses its own
SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. Mac
and Linux users are not affected.

**An improved CLIE**  
With the CLIE PEG-T665C, Sony took everything good about the PEG-T615C--
including its terrific color screen and solid design--and added a faster
processor and MP3 support to make quite an **attractive Palm OS PDA**. But
with Pocket PCs now selling for less than this CLIE and a whole new Palm OS on
the horizon, is this the right time to invest in the T665C?

A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as  $199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a  good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive  models will suit students or home users who need to print letters  or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks.  In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity  paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for  corporate and small-business users.  Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer with the right price and features for you!

**Why we're changing our publishing schedule**  
  
Dear Reader,

As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter
will continued to be published every Friday

Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one
is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in
order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months
now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little
tired.

Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or
meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time
to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.
So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.

Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects
I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer
Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are
nailed down.

For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn
out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer
and see how it works.

I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be
less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-
demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Sincerely,

David Coursey  
Executive Editor  
AnchorDesk

Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still getting
record downloads for our first FREE Gnometome. What does that mean? Simple.
Download all you want - we'll definitely make more. In fact, we've found a way
to get your products and services a little bit of unlimited promotion on the
side, too. And who couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless
your data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you get
featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls to its knees.
We're still sitting at #5 on Amazon. If we ever hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And,
mind you, this hat has been sitting around for quite a while; it smells like
feet. You'd have to eat three sombreros just to get the same amount of
nutrition you'd get from my hat. You're better off just going for the free
stuff, I suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the upgrade; I
avoided spending money on something that would have lasted longer, supported a
helpful cause, and not have killed me earlier."" It makes sense - if you think
about it. The fries aren't going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the
fries, who will?

Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph I like to
call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They went out of their way to
send me an unsolicited e-mail this evening. Now, I know what you're thinking:
""How kind of them, Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in
yesterday's issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop there. I
received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER marketing company. Their
effort was indeed caught by this crafty eye, and my money will be diverted to
other (less-spammish) businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of
saying: you're not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my
patience? I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people from
around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more junk; looks like
Lycos will never get another click from me, either. See what you get when you
tempt fate?

My good buddy, Bill, tells me that Speakeasy.net provides great DSL
connections. He'll even get the credit if I sign up through his affiliate
link! Paul Howes agrees with him, too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not
use PPPoE, and they encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection.
When looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home Services'
page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k upstream, which I have
not seen from any other provider. And that is less than $200 a month, which is
a bargain when you start looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And
Stuart Portner is chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL
providers give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period."" All the more fries for me, dude!

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the best thing to
do with your money is to invest and then ""forget about it."" Our Gnomie buddy
Brian Stevens is the type of guy that likes to play the stock market. He's
always logging into E*TRADE and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work!
We told him to forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This
Excel spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the data
into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE doesn't give me half
the information that Company Overview does, such as insider trades and
financial trends, along with many other tidbits of information."" NOTE: You
must use Excel 2000 or higher for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.

  
**Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/

{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day, and
sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless copies and shortcuts
- and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I don't need a reminder that there
are five shortcuts or six copies of something on my desktop... and that is
where Flexible Renamer comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can
cut off the ""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even make a .txt
file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds. If you don't like your
filename in all caps, then just switch them to lower case and vice-versa. The
possibilities are endless! (You know, I always wanted to change my own name
from ""Chris"" to ""Caspian Wildflowers""...)

{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC, realizing

just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my deleted file. But what if I had
already emptied the Recycle Bin? (Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can
come into play and save the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view
deleted files or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have
to wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up Disk
Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100% certainty)!

{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the new Minimize
To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's title bar next to the Windows
standard Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons."" This program is a must for anyone
who wants to avoid the distractions of other windows popping up over your
active windows. While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top""
command for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five instant
messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages would pop up in front
of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with Actual Title Buttons, I can keep
typing without missing those ""important"" instant messages. The only difference
is that they aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing... especially when
you don't have to close down your programs to do it.

{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward to moving
to our new neighborhood in a little over a month. Everything is better with a
little dash of friendliness, right? Icons are no exception. All the action on
this website is based around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into
different stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be disappointed
when you go around the corner and pick up your Avengers icons from the comic
store. If all this wasn't good enough then maybe this fact alone will send you
to the street of Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This
means you can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities are endless!

 GnomeTIP

I just hate it when I try to install a program and the installation fails. I
hate it even more when the program doesn't leave a log file to help me track
down the problem. Some would say I am out of luck, but as long as the program
uses Windows Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because
for any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging through the
Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ Policies \ Microsoft \
Windows \ Installer. Add a new String value, double-click it, and enter the
following Value data: ""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be
entered in any order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error messages; w = Non-
fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r = Action-specific records; m = Out-
of- memory or fatal exit information; u = User requests; p = Terminal
properties. If you add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add
an exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails, I just
have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log files. They'll vary
in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and end with the .LOG extension. As
always, make sure to backup your registry before making any modifications.

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner  and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail newbie's guide to relaying"". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

If memory serves, RAID was in use when I joined Microsoft

Unfortunately not, it's a one at a time thing.  If it would help
you, I have a script that I use which handles a mbox file at a time,
strips the SA stuff, reports to razor, and can then do things like
open relay checks, reports to spamcop, etc.  It's available via:

As long as you're not using razor2, that is, right?

I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on, 
and report_header was off, because that's the default configuration, and 
not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those 
changes.

I'll give that a looksie.  I've been running a week's worth of 
maillog relay= IPs through rbcheck every Sunday.  Found quite a few. 
I should break up the list and run multiple rbcheck instances.  Just 
haven't gotten there yet though.  I think I'll have either MIMEDefang 
or Procmail keep a copy of messages over a certain score for daily 
razor-reporting.  I could just let SA do it too I suppose.

Say, maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong in SA.  I added 
report_header 1 to my 
/etc/mail/mimedefang/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf but it didn't 
appear to change anything.  I bounced over another copy of spam to my 
spamtrap and it still created the SPAM: attachment.  sa-mimedefang.cf 
has this in it now:

required_hits           1
auto_report_threshold   100
ok_locales              en
rewrite_subject 0
report_header 1
use_terse_report 1
defang_mime 0
skip_rbl_checks 1

I can't figure out if that was the write cf to modify or not.  I also 
have a /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf but it's empty.  I think I 
might be taking too many bites out of too many pies at once. :-)  The 
required_hits changes I made to sa-mimedefang.cf seem to have worked. 
I don't know why the report_header change didn't though.  Any ideas?

Have you tried gconf-editor? It's a GUI front-end to gconf
settings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like
all good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity
configurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have
reasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings
altogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so
many are).

As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that
gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?

Cheers,
Dave.

Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy
chocolate flavoured pieces... :)

Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)

Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.

I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)

Can't speak for the other alternatives, but i've been using scp for

So either you can choose to have a ""docs"" directory inside %{_docdir} by putting : %doc docs (or, totally equivalent, the latter just reminding it's a directory) %doc docs/ Or you can put all files that are in docs/ directly in %{_docdir} : %doc docs/* Try both, poke around, and you should catch the difference if it's not already clear for you. You can also mark any file from the %{buildroot} as documentation (will be listed when using ""-qd"" to query the package's docs) by using %doc with absolute filenames, for example : %doc %{_datadir}/foo-game/manual (this is /usr/share/foo-game/manual, an absolute file) Also, for the packager's convenience, all files in /usr/share/man (aka %{_mandir}) are automatically tagged as %doc. > Also one more thing, whats the best way to work out the dependencies? > as for example with gnuboy, all hte docs and the website says is it > needs SDL. >  > Do I set a Requires: SDL >= 1.2 (as my system uses SDL-1.2.4-5) or just > put Requires: SDL. Build the package once and see if it checks for a specific version, or read the installation notes. Often you'll see ""checking for SDL >= 1.2.0"" for example when running configure, then it's best to also make the package depend on that version. > One more quick question, I'm used to compiling source code no problem > (cannot program, but stumble through), whats the best way for finding > out what RPMS are needed for the Requires & BuildRequires macros? > apart from read all the docs and websites info. Well, read the docs indeed :-) You can also compile the package once without those fields and see what the configure script is checking for (basically, the libs and versions you'll need to add to the BuildRequires:) then once the package is built, query the automatic dependencies that rpm put into it. You'll see for instance if the binaries/libs from the package need SDL, gtk+  etc. Then add those ""Requires:"" and rebuild a final version of the package. Often you can omit some dependencies, for example if a program is checking for glib, gtk+, gdk-pixbuf and gnome libraries when being compiled, BuildRequires: gnome-libs-devel Requires: gnome-libs will be enough since they already depend on the ""lower level"" libs that are glib, gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf. > Once again sorry to bother you with this, but I figured you were the > best one to ask.

 Hmm. It's even worse than using a text editor on a file.

 Don't buy it.

 shift-alt-s should start a shell, alt-d should maximise a window
vertically, alt-q should close a window, alt-w should shade it. These I've
used for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.

 Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in
windowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.

 Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings
still don't work. It's not fair.

Yeah, I disabled the subject rewrite.  I also lowered required_hits 
to 1 (wonder if I can do zero) so that almost all mail is scored--I'm 
testing it right now.  auto_report_threshold was raised to 100 to 
make sure that all mail gets through to me for now.

Ah...  You learn something new every day!  This would make things 
quite a bit easier.  I assume it can handle a mailbox full of mail to 
report rather than a single piece of spam from STDIN.  I'll check the 
docs on that though.

The Bug Count Also Rises


by John Browne
(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)

In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.

Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.

Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
ate at you.

When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""

""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""

""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""

""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""

Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""

""Herb tea?""

""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.

Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""

Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.

""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""

""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
quietly.""

""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
drink herb tea.""

""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.

""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.

Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""

Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
the bodies back from the meetings.

Erps.  I did misword that.  The message (and assumption) was oriented
toward a message that has rewrite_subject on and report_header off...the
default configuration.  For the header removals it contained enough to
also take care of dcc_add_header 1, but not report_header 1.

thanks.

It would?
Sounds like you are talking about setting up a company, to be a vendor....
I'd venture the early days of Debian, Slackware and other involveds there
was no such financing.

Why not just use spamassassin -r?

           Report this message as verified spam.  This will sub-
           mit the mail message read from STDIN to various spam-

That might work easily enough for reasonably rigid

I have my own thoughts on this, and would be very keen to create yet another
new (and different) distro.

Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding, which is the
reason I have not started this project myself... :(

I think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".

Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.

The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)

So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.

While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.

I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.

IMHO, as always...

is beyond the scope of this list. :)

[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.

 Yep.

 Power on the box while pushing the recessed button near the LCD with a
paper clip. On the serial console, you'll see ""press space to enter the
prom"".

 It's a crap prom, but a prom, nonetheless.

 It is to complex. Look at the mess that is gentoo. Just because you can
do something, doesn't mean you should.

 This is actually a raq3. Though, I do have an old raq2 that Liam was
helping me get netbsd on (about all you'll get on a 16MB machine these
days).

 Anyway, I wussed out, and copied hda1:/ to hda2:/boot and set the bootfs
to be hda2. It worked, though it's mounting an ext3fs as ext2. But I'm

The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball. Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO. It *is* a good idea though.  I've been  wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all). I don't discount any other work like for  example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro. Anyone?

There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right? Right.

Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year.

Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called ""Solinux."" How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon  Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux. The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. ""Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux,"" Poletti reported.

How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux.

 Antefacto Embedded Linux...did.

 Nice little distro that'd run on a 64MB flash card (with 12MB free), with
a read-only root filesystem. Perfect for little embedded systems. It was a
very cut down version of RedHat 7.2.

 Must see can we release the build system & everything. That was the
interesting bit. Distros, in general, are a waste of time. You've no idea
how much better something like Debian or RedHat could be than something
you did yourself, unless you picked a niche area.

 Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 The only way I think you can set parameters is with a ""set_params"" line.

 However, when I run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.

 Indeed. Personally, I think it's the sort of reprehensible behavior that
split Unix way-back-when into the mess it was in a few years back, before
Linux...got rid of most of them.

 Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock
people to their OS, they added all sorts of functionality that was not
availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competition
(Motif on non-free OSes, incompatible filesystems etc).

 While a good idea when you share code & standards, in an environment
where you do neither, the user suffers.

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!) However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must  provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary. But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is. You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001. And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a ""real"" company, etc). There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the source will always be free (or minimal cost). Later, Kenn --  Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

I know that.  And no, you shouldn't.  But see below.

I know that, too.

However, the discussion was tending towards
""don't use things like goto and break to alter flow of control
in your program"".  While not valid 100% of the time, it's a 
reasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at
code, it's easier to see how control moves through a 
function if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The
specific example of replacing a break in a while loop with
a modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to
look in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the
loop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular
example wasn't really that good, since the extra test was 
adding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.
Which is much the same as a break really.)

The idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as 
possible when he sees the code.

In a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select
block makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or 
one case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.
Leaving out break statements breaks this assumption.

My point is that, while there are a few situations where it
makes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to 
consider the break at the end of each case more like the
brace at the end of the while block.  

In fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language
was designed such that the continue statement meant fall through
and break wasn't needed:

   select (x) {
      case 1:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      case 2:
         /* do something - falls through to next case*/
         continue;
      case 3:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      default:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
   }

Still, hindsight and all that.  Sigh.

Later,
Kenn

cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good

September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 




 

Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 

But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 

""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 

Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 

That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 

Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 

As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 

Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 

""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 

Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 

The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 

How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 

Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""


Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 

At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 

A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 

Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 

Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 

Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 

""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 

Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 

""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 

Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 

But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 

""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 

""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

I suspect that as part of Chris' set of changes, he cleaned up the
use of the variable that was named ""L"" in FtocCommit (in ftoc.tcl).
Its name got changed from L to lineno

But there's one reference of $L left.   That causes tracebacks if
you attempt to use ""link"" with the current CVS version of exmh.

I guess that most of us don't use ""link"" very often ... I noticed it
last week, but only got time to look and see why today.

If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository would
apply the following patch (to lib/ftoc.tcl) that would be nice.
(It works... and is trivial, and you could perhaps just apply it by
making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and
applying it - there's only one instance of $L in the file, that
should be changed to $lineno)

What threat does Outlook pose to your organization? It places the company, corporate network and data at risk. Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company reputation and liability with customers at risk, and proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned. >> Have you looked into using a custom sequences file? > More detail please?

The only little (unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"", a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that. Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded, some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered as the newest, thus being kept on the system. As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) Matthias --  Matthias Saou                                World Trade Center -------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list";1;0

Some classics from this period, now in a new English translation:

Remaindered at my local Barnes & Ignoble.   The historical reference

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released  version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they  sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your  own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been  changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release  anyway"".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this  from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

Then again, perhaps the particular font I'm using just has bad bytecodes.  That font is ""QuickType II"", grabbed off my Windows partition, where it was installed by I-have-no-idea-which-application. Anybody else experimenting with bytecode-enabled freetype, presumably with different fonts?

It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.    2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.    3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text. Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me.    Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a  sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked,  well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with  and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear. Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"",  shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode  interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with  the bytecode interpreter enabled. When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several  rendering anomalies appear:    - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more      compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".    - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,      causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the      same problem.    - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient      whitespace between them.    - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.    - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled      with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode      interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off.  It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of  making a mess of antialiased rendering.

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the same time, this creates the problem that I cannot  run to the closest compter to check out the new mail.

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

Unusual -  8 n 1 is more common.

I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this
may vary from modem to modem.

An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.

Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.

Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.

The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.

So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.

Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.

""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""

A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?


http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html


Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.

Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.

The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.

He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.

""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""

The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.

His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.

She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""

Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.

He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""

Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest

A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it.""
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:

[root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok

Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to  see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this  isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one  day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew  Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion  of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco  Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the  economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas.

We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite  service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics --  it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as  some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks.

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day.  On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages. Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."" Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP.  As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle Times) http://tinyurl.com/1usn  Bush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html  President Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast Ports http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story  Bush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port Talks Break Off (AP) http://tinyurl.com/1usk  White House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times) http://tinyurl.com/1usm  Cooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle) http://tinyurl.com/1usp  Bush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.html  Trouble On The Docks http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html  (Paid subscription required.)

We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US. The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight? The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks. The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, ""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."" The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar.

fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].



    

    Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.  

    [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. ""Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,"" said 
    a French military analyst. ""But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny."" 

    [...] ""Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"" 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. ""Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years.""

    



Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by 
showing them who's boss.

of rock star for the digital liberties set, to convince the justices to accept 
the unconventional analysis. If they do, the decision could be a turning point

technology companies that are often in the middle.""

wouldnt be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the 
seemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. 
But its actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in 
the age of the Internet."" 'Theres a sense of deja vu to this. Television was 
supposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industrys 
silver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that the VCR is to the American 
film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman 
home alone. (Video sales are now the studios biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, 
Hollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than Nightmare on Elm

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 

*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 

*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 

Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 

*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.";1;0

_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 

I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 

On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 

I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 

In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 

In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 

I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 

I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 

I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 

Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

succeeded in ringing a bell anytime I get a mail
to my inbox (Not Mailing lists, spams etc.) by
using procmail to execute a ""play clink.wav"" on
the ""right"" mails.
Now my demands are growing ;-)
I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would
like the bell to sound on that when I am there.
I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in
the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop, beeing another user?

Any hints.

Despite being the author of SpamAssassin, I've never fixed exmh to do
this.  I am therefore clearly not an exmh hacker ;)

But to simplify -- the first action is piping the message to an external
command, then replacing the message file with the output; and the second
is simply piping the message to another command, then ignoring the output.
I'd say it's easy enough to do, if someone can provide the tcl.

Is this to mount an OS-X partition?
The following would be of interest in that case:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101198676827824&w=2

summary is you should be able to mount FFS readonly,
and the config item probably UFS:

[padraig@pixelbeat ~]$ grep UFS /boot/config-2.4.18-3
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
# CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE is not set

So `modprobe ufs` should work on a standard RH7.3 install?

Pdraig.

I have no clue about ffs but...

In the 2.4 kernel source Documentation/Configure.help there are various kernel 
options CONFIG_JFF* that enable it.

http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/ and http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/ 
are the URLs cited in that documentation. They have links to mailing lists and 
archives which may be able to answer more specific questions.

If you mean Amiga ffs, then thats selectable in the kernel config also :)

Cheers,

Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.

Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.

  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47

I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ;)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.

Aye, but it'll still need a /boot/kickstart/$VER/$IP-kickstart won't it

I'm jumping in here since I'm just back on
ILUG after quite a long break, anyway...

Alan Cox was mentioning that he might have borked
some PNP stuff lately. You could try 2.4.19-ac4
to see if it helps.

True, but would still enable you to do a network install without using boot 
floppies. Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate 
when you'd like to do some changes to it. Gets messier when you'd have a 
boot image on a server, and the only way you can test it is to boot it over 
the network. In any case, it's just one option available.

Too bad they didn't go with that then. Would have been so much nicer than 
the old MSDOS crap. I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being 
able to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need 
to set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom 
takes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that 
allows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all 
depending on what you want to do, I suppose. Sitting here and typing I'm 
realising that it is both a nice thing, and a nasty thing..

Ah well, life sucks as well, some say.. ;)

Thanks for the replies. It turns out that it was an IRQ conflict with an old 
sound card.

Despite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on 
http://www.scyld.com/diag, the 2.4 kernel still picked a card on IRQ 5 and 10.

It works fine now that the sound card is removed, but I'm still confused as to

You could burn a PROM yourself, if you'd wish. I believe that the netboot

talks about Quality Control Charts:

> The tolerance limits for a part are placed outside of the control
> limits and are never inside of them.  Once the control chart has
> been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record
> of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time.
> The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control
> lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent.  When the
> data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being
> made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of
> 1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.

Taking a look at the S&P 500, and 
using the Ibbotson 2000 figures of
13% expected stock return and 20%
standard deviation, and taking the
the actual 2.5 year return on the
S&P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close
to -30%, we find:

-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20)
-30% > -60%

so it still plots out between the
control lines ...

> So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments
> or changes in the process are necessary.  If five to seven points fall
> on one side of the mean, the process should be checked.  When points
> fall outside of the control lines, the cause must be located and
> corrected immediately.

... but maybe we should've checked
the process during the ""long"" bull.

I am experiencing a strange problem since a couple of days now,
I have several folders with unseen sequences, and when there is
new mail they are highlighted. This works fine.

But .. since a couple of days the actual inbox won't be highlighted
any more when there is new mail. On the other hand the unseen window
still indicates if there is new mail in the inbox.

All other folders seem to work properly.

Any hints ?

Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.

The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.

As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can ""spare"".

I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.

One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to just doing 	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all). (That can be done via ""busy"") Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but its implementation could certainly be fixed). kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers";1;0

A good plan, needs an implementation though: 

        http://bl.reynolds.net.au/ksi/email/

hmm. seems down to me.  Basically it's a plan to store hash sums of
URLs/phone numbers found in spam in a DNSBL, for apps like SpamAssassin to
look up.  A little like spamcop's ""spamvertized URL"" list...

It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify. Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, ""If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."" The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- ""without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter. One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's  time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing  details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. ""Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,"" the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May 2001.

Date: Not supplied

Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails: 

    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights. 

    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.

The Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is 
thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial 
bodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: 

    The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for 
    celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in 
    which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that 
    itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that 
    the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of 
    the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by 
    Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model 
    derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, 
    were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the 
    second century AD.) 

    A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus 
    does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been 
    built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the 
    three other planets known at the timeMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other 
    words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known 
    celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, 
    using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the 
    zodiac running round its edge.

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
(duh!), and that happens to include most of what
people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified 
rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be 
changed on build time and not install time, too.

More details about these are at http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/ None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O. POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too. It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut. Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors. In detail, he wrote: > Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally > catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for > nontrivial apps? No way! Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra performance. > OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely > ghetto, but at least they are trying.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice. They might be even older than that. Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned > out to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep > looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" > is not really working so great anymore. Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process polls them. I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards. Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo(). --         Kragen Sitaker      Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

I don't know from Pyzor, but I've always thought that the way services like
Razor and DCC could be truly useful is if there were a bunch of different
ones. We can assign them scores based on how trustworthy each one is, and
when a message is listed in multiple services you can pretty much trust that
it's spam.

Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet. I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need. I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course). But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks. In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal. But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you. http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=4691&highlight=modem Specifically quote: If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.     * Boot off the install CD     * modprobe serial     * setserial (if needed)     * create mount point for other distribution     * mount other distribution     * chroot'd to other distribution     * su - to regular user     * ran wvdial     * switch consoles and install as normal And yes I do give better technical support to people who use distros I like.

of help.

 Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of 
attempts to install but got there. My problem - I have a standard dial-up 
modem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet 
download is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which 
puts the .tgz files on your harddrive. 

 So methinks, I have the software there and all I need to do is install so as 
1) get the necessary programmes to connect to the net and 2) install any 
other programmes I might need.

 What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE 
package, the system goes looking for any dependencies on the net despite the 
fact that the dependencies reside on my hard drive. Obviously I can't install 
anything.

 Have checked all docs on the web page and nothing deals with a standard 
dial-up modem or how to tell the package manager to look for the dependencies 
on the hard drive.

 Anybody able to help me here?

 Thanks in anticipation.

well, smtp being store and forward, what is an smtp proxy? :) that's 
why i said ""proxy"".

probably, the most effective way to stop spam in the long-term is to 
configure your email server to use the SPEWS blacklist and a good open 
relay blacklist.

SPEWS: to force ISPs to take action against spammers 

SPEWS /will/ list entire ISP netblocks /if/ the ISP consistently
ignores/fails to take action on abuse reports over the course of
several months. however, they're pretty quick at delisting once action
is taken. in the long-term, and in absence of global and effective 
anti-UCE regulations, it's the only realistic way to get to a spam 
free internet.

Open relay lists: to protect against relays obviously.

same concept as tmda (smtp ""proxy"") but not as extreme as tmda.net - 
dnsbl, distributed checksum and various other checks.

unfortunately, often spammers provide real return addresses - just not

    In the end, given that you don't know much about TeS or how it

Release Date: August 8, 2002

Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)

Systems Affected:
Macromedia Shockwave Flash - All Versions;
Unix and Windows; Netscape and Internet Explorer

Description:
While working on some pre-release eEye Retina CHAM tools, an exploitable
condition was discovered within the Shockwave Flash file format called SWF
(pronounced ""SWIF"").

Since this is a browser based bug, it makes it trivial to bypass firewalls
and attack the user at his desktop. Also, application browser bugs allow you
to target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,
or the mailing lists they frequent. It is a ""one button"" push attack, and
using anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.

This vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia
Flash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever
Shockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,
news postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing
web-browsing functionality.

Technical Description:
The data header is roughly made out to:

[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too
short)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count
(malformed)][Data]

By creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the
decoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function
pointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as
soon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes
control flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back
from the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a
""call dword ptr [esp+N]"", where N is the number of bytes from the stack
pointer. These ""jump points"" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By
creating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can
examine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with
your exploitation.

This is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been
found in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we
ended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.

Protection:
Retina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of
Flash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their
systems.

Vendor Status:
Macromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:
http://www.macromedia.com/v1/handlers/index.cfm?ID=23293&Method=Full&Title=M
PSB02%2D09%20%2D%20Macromedia%20Flash%20Malformed%20Header%20Vulnerability%2

I hope so, here goes.. simple question.  How do you define
username/passwords in spamnet?  I don't see any fields for this option, so
I'm assuming when someone connects with SpamNet for the first time, they're
given a unique ID that they keep until they change to a new Outlook client?

It would be nice if you could specify which username/password to use.  I'd
like to share my trust account between my work(outlook) and my personal(mutt)
email accounts.

You can use a milter with sendmail that will add an X-header labeling the

issues) ...

Perhaps a feature can be added to razor-report, so that it checks whether a
message is spam before it submits it.  If it is spam, then don't send the
body, 4 signatures, etc, just up the ""rating"" for that individual spam.

And the antonym? Odyssielded. Rhymes with shielded.

http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Odysseus.html

Odysseus was the first to learned the Palladium Oracles from the Seer Hellenus.
Odysseus neutralised (neutronised?) Palladium's defence for Troy.
Odysseus invented the first Trojan Horse.

Incidentally public revelation of the Palladium is supposed to be on
Seventh Day to the Ides of Jun, i.e. 8th. June. The Newsweek article was
a bit late.

For the most part, 99% times 99% users agree on what is spam. This is the
nature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a ""personal trust""
system, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of
the userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,
only after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would
be stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to
bootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.

As regards to the problems with the ""gray"" areas you mentioned, servers
recognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make
individual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence
level they are confortable with.

cheers,
vipul.

Yes, it's definitely extra work.  The question is how much extra 
work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.

Another concern I have with the way the system might be working 
is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.

You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is 
not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

Time will tell.  Time will also tell how good the system is at 
adjusting over time to gaming strategies.

SA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have.  I 
would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.

Lots of theorizing, most of it based on little data.  The key 
premises I'm worrying about though are:

1. Trust system is easy to pollute
2. Trust system is not personal, which makes the assumption that 
all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam

Razor2 seems to have been a long time in coming, apparently is 
quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.

I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.

Well, when studying engineering the rule of thumb was that infinity was 10 times bigger then the most you could expect to use. Therefore I believe in infinite stack.

The Cobalt systems have some neat firmware boot code that will read the
ext2 filesystem and find the kernel itself... if you put it exactly where
they expect it.

if used properly, they actually can make code more readable.  but those
proper occasions are quite rare really.  it's a good idea to avoid them
since over use of goto will create what niall calls ""write-only code.""
what a wonderful expression.  my professors would spend entire lectures
explaining that concept, and yet three little words convey it so well.

Bobby,  Couple of things:  If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting. Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user). apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate. cheers, vipul.

There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero.   So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions... What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net]  Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby,  Couple of things:  If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting. Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user). apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate. cheers, vipul.

I have one more question though.  I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight? ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2 When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install.

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.

If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.

Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864 of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules each.  They weigh 125 kg. You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked maximizes that. It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage.

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like 1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42. (the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW) Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve. But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design. - Adam L.

You assume that they just match people up and marry them off, and neither is
attracted to the other, which is not the case. Even this has arranged
marrage beat by a long way.

Males gets: A wife for a while, and if they actually like each other, for a
long time.
Female gets: Into Britan, out of a country with no real rights for women, no
opportunities for her or her children, out of the polution, AIDS, and an
uncountable number of scary tropical diseases. Not to mention in most cases
living conditions that us spoiled Americans cannot even comprehend.

Yea, the women is definately getting tha bad end of the deal here.

So, you're saying that product bundling works? Good point.

And how is this any different from ""normal"" marriage exactly? Other then
that the woman not only gets a man, but one in a country where both she and
her offspring will have actual opportunities? Oh and the lack of
""de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded"" choices?

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave

spam fighting software.

I was looking at my spamd debug output today, and noticed that it ran
through Razor2 stuff, and then it ran through dccproc, and then it tried to
go through old Razor1 stuff.  I'm assuming (and please correct me if I'm
wrong) that Razor1 is out dated and was to be replaced entirely by Razor2.

If that's the case, can someone please point me to something that explains
how to remove Razor1 from my system?  I don't see a point in envoking it.
Especially when it appears to error out on me.

Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""

Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch

Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET

BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.

The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.

Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.

""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.

In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.

""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.

""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.

Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.

An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.

And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.";1;0

I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?

Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?

It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static.

surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense

There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good  starting point to search is http://www.freshmeat.net/ However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as  they are on Windows platform for two main reasons: 1.

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in
workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You
draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take
about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully
listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts
and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of
this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to
imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.""

Works!  There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle
finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found
the boundary, and repeated the motion.  He left my office!

Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's


Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"",
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)

We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,
A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
Everyone you meet is your mirror.

You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to
waste what you do have.

The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be
in the Eternal Now Moment

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions
and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

The
purpose
of our lives
is to be free
of all addictive traps,
and thus
become one
with the ocean of
Living Love.

Folks,

     There have been several major internet outages this morning,
     across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.
     Various routes across the Internet backbones have been
     disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.

     This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are
     working on correcting right now.  We apologize for the
     inconvenience..

the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..

In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.


Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.


Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )

Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier currently : 1. Leave your current kernel as-is 2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem, NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm. Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-) Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

argh, they do not, do they?   the FPs must be just gigantic :(

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.

Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.

That 1 is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel

we use ""console=ttyS0,9600n8"" but the 9600 is mainly cos we are a cisco

probably there are more elegant solutions, but if your zips are in one
directory you can do something like

for i in *.zip
do
if unzip -v $i | grep -q FILEYOUWANT
then
~  echo $i
fi
done

razor-agents 2.14 needs all parts to be spam to make a positive decision

Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
2.50 though.

Matt.

Sure thing :) I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a 	rpmbuild --recompile  --without oss --without isapnp (I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)). Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package installed.  I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used --without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way to do that. I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs  don't help much. Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules from source.  It created the /dev files and all. Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec: rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp --without kernsrc But I get this: ==[long successful compile snipped]===================================== warning: File listed twice: /dev/adsp warning: File listed twice: /dev/amidi Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: /bin/sh /bin/sh rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(interp): /bin/sh /bin/sh Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(post): /bin/sh Requires(postun): /bin/sh Requires: alsa-kernel = 0.9.0rc3 /sbin/depmod Processing files: alsa-kernel-0.9.0rc3-fr4_2.4.19 Finding  Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding  Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires: alsa-driver = 0.9.0rc3 kernel = 2.4.19 Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root error: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound RPM build errors:       File listed twice: /dev/adsp       File listed twice: /dev/amidi       Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:      /etc/makedev.d/00macros      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound ======================================================================== Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand much of what's going on here.

   Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with
Tru64 and that took care of it.

   When I did the ""make install"" I got this error:

LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
*** Exit 2
Stop.

   It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?

Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not listed in the %files section.

It should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today. Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's choice of 5 just adds an offset.

Perhaps we look at the sequences file > more than once per message view?   As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file  first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This  happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences. That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to  have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what  messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add another  call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time  technique would be less error-prone. I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow  a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the  current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences  for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday. And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is nobody's problem but Habeas's. A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).   If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1, there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their thresholds to 5.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam, and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g., SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed. Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops, then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that everybody has to pay them for. The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it. [*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could  consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk";1;0

Latest guestimate stats from Ireland's NUA show a flattening Internet

the USA at 59% (since 2000!), Denmark flatlines at 60%, Norway at 54%, 
Sweden at 64%, and the UK at 55% ... only Iceland continues unfettered

clear signal that there's as much fortune to be gained from a

Better yet, let the GA figure out the correct score. ;-) That will obviously
take awhile since you'll have to acquire enough messages with it, but it
should give you a good idea if the presence of Habeus headers are good spam
indicators or not.  If they are, my guess is that Habeus will probably not
succeed.

Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee to
organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole
revenue stream to come from legal judgements?  On the one hand, if they
charge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhat
less critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generate
license fees.  If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way and
they'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more
revenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.  Either way, it
seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk.

Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right 
after the line that says:

#define EX__MAX 77

Add:

#if !defined __osf__
extern char *optarg;
typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address */

(you're adding the two lines that start with #).

It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the computer is halted, even using ALSA.

This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative
about adding unproven RBLs and such, and this should be the same.

I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

Date: Not supplied

Since the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). 

Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.

It came out a while ago, but Ben Hammersley reviewed AmphetaDesk and a few 
other free aggregators in his Guardian article, Working the web: Newsreaders[1]
. In more timely news, OSDir[2], a repository of ""stable, open source apps"", 
has reviewed AmphetaDesk[3] and labels it an 'OSDir.com preferred' app. They 
also give you the ability to rate AmphetaDesk[4] on a scale of 1-10. You can 
see the current rating here[5].

not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend

Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on 
Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden 
NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.";1;0

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code";1;0

Date: Not supplied

Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 

Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 

Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. 

Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 

But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.

Date: Not supplied

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 

Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 

A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 

But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 

Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. 

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 

There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

Ray Ozzie has more on platforms[2]. ""Finding the 'right' price point for a 
software platform is critical."" To me this sounds like a fancy way of saying, 
""I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous, 
but I can't bring myself to do it."" The price, Ray says, ""must be high enough 
both 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create 
significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is 
assured of the platform's ultimate viability."" What he doesn't mention: if you 
lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, 
which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have 
to close. But that must be what he's thinking.

Date: Not supplied

I received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.

Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.

It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.

The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.

I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

""I told you so."" never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""

Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.

To cover the list specifically:


- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.

- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.

- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.

- Message display - Yes. No argument here.

- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.

- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).

- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.

- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)

- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.

- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.

I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing.

_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 

Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. 

MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 

I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.

The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.

Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 

Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

Date: Not supplied

Bug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.

While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!

You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.

We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.";1;0

A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.

Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.


- The link toolbar is: 


- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?

- The sidebar is 


- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate



- Form auto-fill 


- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically



- Downloads 


- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.



- Toolbars should 


- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason



- Composer should 


- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.



- Mail should 


- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.




Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 

Why? 

A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.

Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.

Date: Not supplied

Amazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery 
system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate 
(but well-compensated) deliverypeople: 

    As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked 
    up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
    work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before 
    the commuters return. 

    Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that 
    identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination 
    stations and the address to which it is to be delivered. 

    After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest 
    railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination 
    station. 

    At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
    re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. 

    The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons 
    and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and 
    returned when they came. 

    The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin 
    box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
    office.

Morten Frederiksen has taken a first stab at a real-time social network 
explorer based on FOAF files. You could start on my profile[1] and explore from 
there, or enter the URL of your own FOAF file (at the bottom of the page). It's 
heavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a 
great way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need 
somebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty 
social network diagrams, so we can see the forest for the trees.

Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal  charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into  AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal. Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush  administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.   The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.  So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that  make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but  that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. -  Jen Muehlbauer Homestore Executives Agree to Guilty Pleas  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3165-2002Sep25.html Homestore, AOL Ad Deals Yield Guilty Pleas (USA Today) http://tinyurl.com/1nbz U.S. Focuses on Executive at Homestore http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/technology/26AOL.html Homestore's Ex-Execs to Aid Investigators http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homestore26sep26,0,5107257.story Probe of Homestore Turns To an Ex-AOL Executive http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032971619118707713,00.html (Paid registration required.)

The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified Jean-Marie Messier. Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24  paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.   The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still  had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation."" There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu,  an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake  in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone conference.  The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his  head.""  With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt?

Brian sez: Vocera Communications has developed what is essentially a Star Trek: 
TNG-style lapel communicator device that uses WiFi to transmit voice across 
networks. 

    The Vocera Communications System consists of Vocera Server Software, 
    residing on a customer premise server, and Vocera Communications Badges, 
    which operate over a wireless LAN (802.11b). The badge - which weighs less 
    than 2 ounces - includes a microphone and speaker, LCD readout to display 
    text messages, and an 802.11b wireless radio. It can be clipped to a shirt 
    pocket or collar, or worn on a lanyard.

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

Date: Not supplied

A new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
ways to earn a living with it. 

    Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG... 

    ""They complain about the Napsters,"" she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. ""But why do 
    the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them."" 

    Steel said that if the issue ""is not on boardroom table ... then that 
    boardroom has problems.""

Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMT

Mixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. 

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). 

Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  

I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  

At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  

Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! 

More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. 

Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the 
planet.";1;0

Whoops. You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay. ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive. It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization, rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds, eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold (90%?). Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it? Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic It obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them). If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically, in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends. UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the LAN) are handled differently. For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available. For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion, which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts. ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped. >_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on > the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that. The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the ""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work. Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second.

Umm, don't get me wrong here, but I think you've been fed a less-than- accurate sales pitch. Let's ponder this for a minute. The device works by delaying ACKs... that is: packets with the ACK flag set, right? ... [letting this sink in for a while] ... Yes, all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set. So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded? Whoops. Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed, but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written (dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available. But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic. Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate. So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of it is wrong. (Sorry.) What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong. And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.

You're missing the NEW state. The initial SYN packet will not match with either of the first two rules.

You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain, introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.

Those old white dudes could never see a world that wasnt ALL deeply
religeous (science wasnt up to speed yet). How could you not hold these
principles as just how you should act? They got that religeon and government
should not be the same thing, they didnt get that when society doesnt have
any beliefs are all (capitalism is more atheist then communism ever was) it
quickly goes to hell as some people have 100 billion and all the rest have
too dolla a day.

Having been raised in a generally ethical way, it was a big jump to learn to
run a business. Lots of lessions in being ruthless, and a few about being
sure to hire large Italians to do debt collection (it works!).

No shit, really? Seriously, if you're not all about screwing over the

scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people
reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people
themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend
to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.
    We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were
blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful
friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.
    We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not
noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human
beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves
as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no
less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same
the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.
    Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of
the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,
perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect
to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,
subdivided mankind.
    Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the
Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter
how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given
membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one
their public servants formed.

We hope that in the next generation we can bring back what we once thought
of as our future, or more aptly thier future will be a shade better than
what ours is turning out to be.

I cant help but appologise to my wifes bulging middle in these last few
dyas of the pregancy. I wanted so much more for him. My daughter and I
talk about this in the ways an 8 year old can with a 39 year old. She
realizes things are not all they could have been, but shes sort of ready
for the challange. She told me the other day she would get to the moon if
I dont. Gota love kids, they say the coolest things at just the right
times.

As for profit and the drive towars it...moeny is simply a tool,simply one
way of many to facilitate living the life you want. Too many have taken
the tool for the goal, the race for the prize and the notion that first is
all.

Yea yea, this sad burlesque.

I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but  I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing or not.  Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster which has over the years increased the distance between the rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks all impacting at different times, others may have this same type of design and could be in different stages of increasing distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter? So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

Dear Investor,

Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""

We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 

Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.

Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 

More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest.

Advisor.

Gardner.  We'll tell you exactly why we believe a 
stock is poised for significant growth -- and give you 
all the facts to back that analysis up.  You'll get 
the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.

Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.

You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking 
opportunities.  And you can log on anytime at the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, 
featuring current & back newsletter issues...full 
updates on our selected stocks...Q & A...and more.

This is called ""pseudo-packages"" or ""meta-packages"" and Debian has been using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty packages. Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like them.

Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the 
meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the 
corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and 
more apprehensive towards American Democracy.

I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the 
monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set 
in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our 
government could be so far removed from those honorable principles. 
Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself 
through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America 
seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the 
real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your 
copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie. 
Health care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are 
now regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.

Ah, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave. I hear Spain 
is nice this time of year...

Or perhaps it is the unregulated and out of control capitalism used as a
tool to concentrate wealth and form a greed-based society?

I notice the top 5 have a good amount of socialism in their systems to
regulate the capitalism, especially in things like health care and
education.

Just look at our health care - no insurance = no care. Or education - gimme
my voucher so I can get my kids out of the system while their IQ is still
over 20.

South American countries are currently figuring out just where this
greed-based system ends up, and are looking for a way out.

It was a fun ride tho wasnt it?

This is for one reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems. Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have significantly more access to business management than we ever will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft. In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April 2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E) company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a barnburner like Nokia, one is enough. Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999, Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058 But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059 The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999, Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it. WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds. Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!"" http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061 I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even way below. http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062 As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER"" For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063 As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out. HOMEWORK For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following: - Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four   quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,   staying about the same, or weakening? - Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past   four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing   slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures? - Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past   three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net   income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look   at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around   due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much   more indicative of real cash flow trends.) - If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center   and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know   whether your company has any debt, just type your company name   into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)   http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064 - Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its   current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is   there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario   already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,   this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's   still a question you should consider.) To help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information Form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. You can get to by clicking here. We've also outlined how to find all of the information above, here. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690065 http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690066 So dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. Quarterly financial data is best found in company 10-Qs, and annual data is best found in company 10-Ks. You should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at Fool.com on the Quotes & Data area. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690067 FEELING A LITTLE LOST?

Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks
out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux
impacting the fissibles). It is *not* designed to apply a 100 MT warhead

most assuredly will scarcely fragment a 2 km target in the few seconds
left before the impact. This is so obvious it doesn't even to need to be
modeled.

The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The
only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting
long-term. Decades for targets this size.

Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say

WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.

(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.

(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.

(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.

(e) all of the above.

""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""

The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.

In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.

""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""

Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. 

Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

Luckily, I'm in no such predilection as technolumpen.

However, the signs do seem to head for a much deeper crapper than the one
we're currently in, and this has relevance to those switching jobs, or
those just entering the job market. Nano/bio startups are all screwed up,
alas. It's too early to wait for the radioactive glass to cool down while
the nukes are still going off, imo.

This topic comes up every so often on this list.  The short answer is 
no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.

The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.

You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.

Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.

The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.

Hey, that thing is 2 km across and 28 km/s fast. There's nothing you can
do just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with
tiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying
them. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not
enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at
least we can't develop and deploy them on time, so that only leaves you
with nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would
risk fragmenting it) on rocks of unknown composition (could be a pile of
rubble for all what we know) has never been tried yet, though.

It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a 
capture. But here trying to brake a smaller object (say, few 100 m across) 
with final stage aerobraking would be far more useful. Otoh, one could as 
well could invest that effort into a launch capacity on the Moon.

Doesn't apply to this one; you're off by three orders of magnitude.
Only 2km diametre, this one.  Of course, that's still a lot of mass
to hit the planet even if it *is* in the form of dust and gas.
Even if Shrub's wrist-rocket managed to vaporise it, we'd still get
transference to the Earth's energy balance, only to the atmosphere
rather than the litho- or hydrosphere.

Assuming a 2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12 cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the weight of 200 kg here on Earth. So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about four orders of magnitude too small. If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1 cm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s, or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not possible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass, as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything approaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around 2.2 cm/s instead. The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU). (And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.) The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed acceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if we were to start accelerating it now. All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its gravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile in ways I don't understand. They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference is probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path. What about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to provide the needed acceleration? Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other direction, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over twenty-five years to adjust its orbit. *** About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better solutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK mail to be detained for scanning.

This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an essay about why some event happened.

These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.

Delay is generally defined as the time it takes from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually has many components.

Triple-digit Dow gains at 2PM...);"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 A bull market climbs a wall of worry -- on record volume. Yeah, I know, it's different this time. Pay no attention to the bear behind the curtain, and all that. However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and Henry ""Dr. Doom"" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might* come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing, key-punching ""administration"" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago, chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what, 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting... A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a pressurized cabin to breathe in. So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for a house, tulips are still nice things to have around. Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you will. So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while there's blood in the streets. As to whether the accounting is ""rigged"", remember what Robert Heinlein said: ""Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you don't play."" Cheers, RAH The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look behind the curtain, right? :-). - --- begin forwarded text From: Somebody Else To: ""R.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely

1629;Mario Torre <neugens@libero.it>;secprog@securityfocus.com;Thu, 22 Aug 2002 20:15:15 +0200;Encryption approach to secure web applications;"Hi everybody!

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).

This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.

The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.

A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Where I can found good documentation about this topic?

There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.

First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.

The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.

In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Mario Torre

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy
protection than sending a copy of the same message to everyone on the
Internet, so the recipients can't be blamed for reading it.

Wait till phone spam is as cheap to send as email spam...

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter

However, the additional  information won't be required. The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as  campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the  same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous  political spam. Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had  asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring  financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would  use up too much of the 160 character-maximum. Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from  the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was  supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular  Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade  groups. FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the  commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the  potential to reach more voters. ""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said. Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous. Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface. Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as  ""good for America."" ""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office,"" he said.

Why do you say Dell is cheaper than DNUK?

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being

http://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htm

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""


Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

 Thu 22 Aug 2002 

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at 7.99

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then Im gone."" 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

You'd want to either add your own compensation rule or up (negatively)
the whitelist score.

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world.

tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 
advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 
the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 
founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 
for the Los Angeles Times.

I've sent in some spam that either didn't score or scored practically 
nothing, like below 5.  I figure that most people run at 5 so if it 
scores less than that, a rule needs to be honed to catch it.

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in

Consider it on my list of things to check. Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't  support the icon window. However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality  which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always  show sequences"" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in  the help window for ""Icon Window"" as it already is for ""Hide When Empty"".

It does, if you have a corpus of german spam and nonspam to feed

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

What happened to more highly-capitalized
land?  Putting in trees instead of crops
sounds like it might sidestep that.

That's understandable.  HTML mail is the worst thing since female

Sound pretty slick.  If I come across any more legit newsletters,

I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions.    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security admin's job would be a lot harder.

Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills | itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else. |  | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. |  | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the | vulnerability, if possible.   |  | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible | disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was. |  | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible | disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the | underground, vulnerable. |  | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible. |  | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.   |  | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if | HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the | information. |  | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, | together, add up to a catastrophe. |  | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later, | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. |  | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be | --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. |  | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. |  | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist. |  | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in | Samba, for example. |  | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. |  | Let's not let that happen. |  |  |  |  | This is the original iDEFENSE announcement: |  | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] | Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program |  |  | Greetings, |  | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. |  | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program: |  | Q. How will it work? | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number | of motivations, including the following: |  |          * Pure love of security research |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure |  | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following | items: |  |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided |          * The potential severity level for the information shared |          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other |            software and hardware potentially affected |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs |          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE |  | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other | entity. |  | Q. Why are you launching this program? | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the | public at large are warned in a timely manner. |  | Q. Who gets the credit? | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or | exploit information. |  | Q. When can I contribute? | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today. |  | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please | contact us at contributor@idefense.com. |  | Regards, |  | Sunil James | Technical Analyst | iDEFENSE |  | ""iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively | monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and | hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. | The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline | security professionals and network administrators with timely access to | actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. | iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines | the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new | software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."" |  | http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork |  --  ""It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."" 					               -Hume http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork";1;0

Try www.hosting365.ie - they haven't let me down yet.

You could try iewebs.com aswell, though I don't know if they do ""just hosting"".

Why is it that I envision Verisign doing something like this.  Yeah,

Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002


The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.

And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything 
specific on this scenario.

Here's the situation. 
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into 
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it 
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of 
this file, I use 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion 
on this point is immaterial)
:0
  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
  { }
:0 c
 $SAVEAT

I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
  * ^From: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/null

Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tld

It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with 
:0 
 * ^Subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.

The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files 
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the 
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun 
example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other 
messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- 
other users have no problems.

Any suggestions would be helpful :)

----------------
How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.

The goverment mindset is now, If you know a vulnerability and let it on to
anyone BUT the manufacturer you are a criminal...end of story, go directly
to jail do not collect 200$ and tip a hat to the citizen infromants who
helped get you there.

So this leaves lucrative contracts for those who find and then NDA the
find with the manufacturer with, if the finder is smart, an imunity from
any prosecution in the future so long as the NDA is kept.

which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
anyone else.

If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.

At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
vulnerability, if possible.  

This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
was.

The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
underground, vulnerable.

The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
long as possible.

iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  

Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
information.

If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
together, add up to a catastrophe.

First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.

Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
--- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.

I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.

I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
are good at networked theft may not yet exist.

There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
Samba, for example.

Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
increase the availability of that information to the people who can
afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.

Let's not let that happen.




This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:

From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]
Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM
Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program


Greetings,

iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.

iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
provides answers to some basic questions about the program:

Q. How will it work?
A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
of motivations, including the following:

         * Pure love of security research
         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure

The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
items:

         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)

It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't
recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".

Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
leaves you with a sinking boat.)

So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.

*Q AND A SECTION*

*SHIVER MY TIMBERS*

/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.

It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".

It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.";1;0

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings

  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network

  ###

  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.

  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.

  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.

  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.

  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.

  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""

  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""

  About Magi
  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms
  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration
  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can
  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and

It was even less so thirty years ago. My story remains the same, take it 
or leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to 
suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.:

I don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend 
to the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you 
say it, even in France. I don't care where the political pendulum has

computer languages. Recently Dan Brian improved on that with a little bit
of natural language processing. Now [1]The Perl Review makes pretty
pictures of it all. Based on searches of AltaVista and Google, we found
that not a lot of people think PHP or Lisp sucks, a lot think C++ and
Java suck, and they put Perl is somewhere in the middle. Does Perl suck
more than it use to suck, or has PHP just shot way ahead?""

2539;John Gay <johngay@eircom.net>;ilug@linux.ie;Thu, 18 Jul 2002 23:13:24 +0100;Re: [ILUG] CVS question?;"Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Cheers,

	John Gay

CNET Reviews  
|  |  **Dear readers,**  
The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't touch the
passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week, Apple devotees gathered
in New York to find out what their guru, Steve Jobs, has in store for them.
They were not disappointed, with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which
continue to push the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with Windows. Read the
full coverage from CNET's News.com.

Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and the
PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.  
_\--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends_

**1** | **Gene Kan:**  
Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June 29 in an apparent
suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET community. Last week, search requests
for information on 25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the peer-to-peer space,
many credit him with legitimizing file sharing--making it about more than
music, according to Wired News.  
---|---  
**2** | **Macworld:**  
The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a good show, whether or not
Steve Jobs has anything real to announce. So far, it looks like Apple has
already surprised a few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No.
7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire.  
**3** | **PayPal:**  
It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and PayPal deal. Soon after eBay
announced it was buying PayPal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit
claiming that PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its involvement with
online gambling transactions.  
**4** | **Wi-Fi:**  
I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the Buzz Meter
permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting interest because of a possible pact
between tech heavyweights, including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon
Communications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public
areas where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as airports.  
**5** | **eMac:**  
This is the for-education-only computer that consumers wanted so badly that
Apple released it to them. The CNET review is out, and here's the word: the
eMac is what the iMac used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly
inexpensive computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
processing and accessing the Web.

**Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions**  
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a
worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.

Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors
seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time
Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at
America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close
at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88
percent, to close at 1,356.95.

Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held
steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials
dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P; 500 slid
24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.

**AOL used unconventional business practices-Post**  
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals
from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the
Washington Post reported on Thursday. A chart printed in conjunction with the
Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.  
 **AOL TIME WARNER INC 12.45 -5.03%**

**IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits**  
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-
quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer
maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.
But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from
computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as
corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology
spending.

**Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2**  
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight
rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third
quarter versus the April-June period. ""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it
will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some
previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following
the firm's second-quarter result.

**J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02**  
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm
and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of
Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate
a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant
asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that
can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.

**Dell: PC Market Slow and May Stay So**  
The stumbling economy continues to dampen demand for personal computers and
could do so for the rest of the year, Dell Computer Corp. Chief Operating
Officer Kevin Rollins said on Thursday. Despite the slow market, No. 2
computer maker Dell is gaining market share, partly because of the recent
merger of Hewlett Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp., Rollins told
reporters after Dell's annual shareholder meeting here.

|  **Dear Readers,**  
I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right
while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this
bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature
cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But
what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my
privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this
interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing
these miniature cameras, called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them.
So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about
this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting
caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project.
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers
volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. Linux
users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations
that might be in need of such skills. And, I've seen some very interesting
suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of
the above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though.
keep the subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and
sort through my email system.

It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users.
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee
on its previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an
OS 10.2 upgrade at $129.

I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years.
Revenues, by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s
and early 2000\. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income,
some of which were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch
in the past few years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the
newsletters will remain free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative
income sources.

On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According
to their most recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest
in the company's history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue.
That doesn't put them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the
strong quarter will only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much
of this revenue was the result of the Mandrake Linux User's Club.

The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded
computers for sale on WalMart.com. I would never have guessed that WalMart
would lead the consumer Linux machine charge. They've had Mandrake boxes
available for several months. Now, with the addition of both Lindows and
Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.

Have a great Wednesday.

**Checking Mail With KMail**

I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me
from my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail,
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the
KDE desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.

There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and
simple configuration issue.

To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon
in your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute
window, change the command line to read:

    kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m

The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail
when you open the program.

Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

**Kernel Configuration - Part XIII**

As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed
to stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It
should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux
kernel configuration is dense with details and options.

I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections
of the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas.
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and
external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.

For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:

The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo  
  covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel
configuration issues

Linux Network Security from Linux Planet  
  a nice tutorial on network security

Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4  
  other approaches to network security

These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your
Linux kernel.

""PyMP3Cut is a Python commandline tool designed to cut huge (> 100MB) MP3
files at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time
usually needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to
more easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything. It reads and
cuts simultaneously according to the autodetected MP3 frame rate and a
timeline passed as a commandline argument.""

**Linux PR**

http://linuxpr.com/

If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time
for a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and
developments in the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most
recent articles in descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans
easy. The only real downside to the news on the site is that some of it is
very, very company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press
releases. Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and
keeping up on your favorite OS.

Rop Gonggrijp admits that it's not a promising time to start an Internet
privacy company. The founder of NAH6 knows all about flops such as Privada,
abandoned software such as PGP and SafeWeb, and struggling firms such as Zero
Knowledge.

with its .Mac Web services plan.

**Microsoft unbundles directory technology**  
Microsoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product
separate from the Windows operating system. Microsoft will continue to build
in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the
new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft
executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a
network manager with a central database to store and manage information about
users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against
Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

**Pittman set to leave AOL Time Warner**  
AOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday
that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role
as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the
company. Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the
company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a
permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be
based on his own decision, the source added. AOL Time Warner last week
confirmed that it hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to head AOL's CEO
search.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday when it refused to
boot completely. I borrowed a data vac from a friend and decided to clean all
of the dust and cat hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything,
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where there is a POST
progress bar, but would not proceed past past about the first 1/5th of the
bar. Uh-oh. What did I fry?

As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the small stuff"". Oh, I
had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, I checked all of
that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later
that I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. That
server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the
yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the
switch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message
like every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS
developers. Server Satchel, running Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it
was previously. The penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How
appropriate...

**Windows XP Security Checklist**  
Finely crafted by Bernie Klinder

http://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm

With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP, where does one
start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an appropriate file system choice
for you? Is there any value at all in Simple File Sharing? After much
hounding, Bernie Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need
to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system that is both
security and compatible with the rest of your computing world.

**ATI Still Makes Video Cards?**

http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656

Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have something to say about
NVIDIA's dominance in the video card market. Seeing as how they've been all
but dumped by the majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from what AnandTech has
to say about the forthcoming R300-based cards, it appears that they haven't
thrown in the towel just yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the
effective re- entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their
driver development has improved as much as their hardware seems to have.

**Technical Censorship**

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a
minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I
wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an
alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of
you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and
the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in
drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized
HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in
their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another
filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript
functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.

**Yer Kidding... Really?**

http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html

I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us that have had to
manage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software,
maintenance and personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of Linux on a server
with less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and
maybe an Intranet page or three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very
long last, Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to point
out that they have much more to offer than Linux, which may indeed be true.
But at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like
functions against one another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional
training, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it
comes to detailed configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. Cheap is in
the budget of the beholder.

I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate
listening to good music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore. Melanie, Steve,
Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and Mindy had a total blast.
Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got his digital camera confiscated - but
this was a show worthy of five megapixels (believe me)! Brent went to the show
last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this afternoon. They were
selling a new CD (which had JUST been released the other day); ""They Got Lost""
is full of a few previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about
purchasing it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic
account and download a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the
opening act: Noe Venable. She's got a few free MP3s on her site, too. Give
""Boots"" a shot - very nice.

Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me as a gift
(which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the manual - but the ones
and zeros start to look eerily similar after flipping past the first page. You
know me: I'm not much of a math guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day
that 'byte' was short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece, but it just
isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that? I'm ready to walk on the
wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've
been known to do nutty things on a moment's notice, like changing my default
Web browser. Courtesy of Asa Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD,
and t-shirt (which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has plenty of goodies to go around.

Looks as though Jake and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis. They're
at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds of well-known
program programmers - the people who make our computers work the way we want
them to work! We're doing our best to convince them to join us at Gnomedex.
They ask: ""Who else is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know
you yet."" They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to learn
anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help you there, but
here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the admission price includes food at
at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We cannot provide every meal, but you won't go
hungry."" They ask: ""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We
answer: ""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex."" Get
it? Got it? Good.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

**GigAlarm v1.201 [33k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://users.bigpond.net.au/glina/GigAlarm.htm

{String on your finger} Sometimes, I'm a bit like the absent-minded
professor... I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I
appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can
setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text
message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of
GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a
WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program,
or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the
habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too
long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The
author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit
purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5
USD) as a token of your appreciation.""

  
**Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREE**

http://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/

{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my
computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my
image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context
Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view
an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and
there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open
up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always
ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window,
including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context
Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I
want to save system resources.

Recommend It!

**Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREE**

http://codestuff.tripod.com/

{Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup
Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's
a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task
Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from
where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it
also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and
export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over
your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when
you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.

**Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15**  
Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhin

http://www.aversoft.com/sticker/

{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I
use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a
whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important
information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No
more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of
paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no
accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only
half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other
programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your
notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating
or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.
Time to send out today's newsletter!

thought processes? Just browse through any one of Wikipedia's many categories
until you find a subject that piques your interest. From Physics to Opera;
from Anthropology to Cooking, you will find it all here. Now, all that is

 GnomeTIP

Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no
exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can
copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also
had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a
new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from
the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse
button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right
mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text
(along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips
Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X
to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then
just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the
right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving
yourself some time.

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.

First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and
Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and
I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in
the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any
other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've
attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a
huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all
about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts,
and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No
hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find
a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of
luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet
for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I
really do hope to see you there.

Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores.
That's right. Jake has release a **FREE** GnomeTome on ""Converting Vinyl LPs
to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well,
my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't
know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead
- ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there,
check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.

Have a great Tuesday.

**Setting the Home Page in Konqueror**

Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE.
Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web _and_ file browser. You can use
it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been
something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a
browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question -
it's a web browser and a web broswer only.

Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror
browser and end up in your /home/ _user_ directory. Have no fear, though. It's
an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.

Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure
Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the
text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL""
text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the
home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home
page. Select OK to close the window.

Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser
to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save
View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your
the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.

Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it
act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

**Kernel Configuration - Part XII**

Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of
Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They
both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy.
That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.

Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple
discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally,
there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and
RAID-5.

Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In
other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no
redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further,
there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one
drive in the RAID array at a time.

RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the
first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no
redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives,
not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0
will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.

RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, _does_ provide data redundancy. This is the
first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array.
All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at
least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall
RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can
actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is
written across multiple discs.

RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity
information while striping the data across the others. This is much like
Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data
_can_ be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but
this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is
probably the least used of the RAID schemes.

RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed.
Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than
reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the
array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can
be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration
will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after
the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5
is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.

With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel
configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to
configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel
configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the
RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate
option.

Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

**Windows Apps in Linux?**  
Scribbled by Robert Nix

""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine for my
needs.

""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only app
keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac OS X and
it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far been
unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash will
eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't help now.

""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products are
overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a section
on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)""

**Important Unix Manpages**

http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/

Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge
and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved
quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a
Linux newbie's best friend.

Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually
have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than
machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like
Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

excess?**

**If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the
issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.**

Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary
technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how
corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal
""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington.

No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on
the table--make that _a lot_ of food, in some cases--but about the way the
computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a
different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and
Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.

Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun
foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider
this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more
than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That
was good for a seventh place ranking, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.

**Group proposes PC protection guarantees**  
Several **U.S. government** agencies have teamed with an international
Internet security organization to support a set of benchmarks aimed at
guaranteeing a **minimum security standard** for computers. While **Windows
2000** workstations are the first benchmark that the disparate organizations
have agreed upon, others to follow include **Cisco IOS** for routers, Solaris,
Linux and HP-UX. Reaching agreement on these benchmarks will not be a walk in
the park.

**As the rhetoric turns**  
Last year, **Steve Ballmer** called the GPL on which Linux is based a ""
**cancer**."" This year, **Linux is a ""unique competititor**."" The emergence of
Linux as a serious competitor to Windows has forced Microsoft to change the
way it approaches customers, Microsoft's CEO acknowledged at this week's
Fusion 2002. Microsoft traditionally has played its **""low price, high
volume""** game against IBM, Oracle and others. Now it must figure out how to
beat Linux, which has an even lower cost -- free.

**Wi-Fi can wait**  
The next iteration of Wi-Fi (aka **802.11a** ) may be getting a lot of
interest, but rolling it out now, says **Gartner** , would be jumping the gun.
The anointed successor to the **802.11b** modulation scheme provides up to
five times the throughput over its predecessor. When will it be ready for
prime time?

**More large-scale worm attacks? Brace yourself**  
It's been a year since the **Code Red** worm wreaked havoc on the Net. What's
changed? Internet worms have become **much more robust** since Code Red. And
that doesn't bode well, since antivirus software hasn't kept up with all the
changes. So far in 2002, we've been lucky. **Robert Vamosi** tells you how to
prepare for future threats.

recommends**

**Macworld hears roar of Jaguar**  
At this week's Macworld, Apple CEO **Steve Jobs** heralded the early arrival
(August 24) of **Mac OS X version 10.2** (code-named Jaguar), which features
improved search features plus **QuickTime 6** with support for MPEG-4. Also:
An iPod for Windows, a 17-inch flat-panel iMac, new charges for iTools Web
services and a leg-up for Mac Office.

**Why we're changing our publishing schedule**  
  
Dear Reader,

As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter
will continued to be published every Friday

Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one
is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in
order to meet deadlines. I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months
now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little
tired.

Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or
meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time
to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends.
So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.

Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects
I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer
Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are
nailed down.

For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn
out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer
and see how it works.

I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be
less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-
demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.

Sincerely,

David Coursey  
Executive Editor  
AnchorDesk

To answer partly the original question, this might have been useful once the %files error was corrected : rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit  This will skip all the way to the %install and start from there. Of course, you need to have already done everything else before, and this will _not_ produce any rpm files, but will at least tell you if everything is now able to finish successfully. Sure, it's not perfect since if the %files error was actually because entries were missing you'll notice it only once the package is really installed. But for multiple typos in the %files section (like when you're writing a spec file after 2AM ;-)) it can come in handy :-) It's also very useful if you need to override some Makefile variables during install, when the simple cases like ""%makeinstall"" or ""make install DESTDIR=%{buildroot}"" don't work. It keeps you from redoing all the unpacking and building processes.

Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
honest-to-god T1.

I still disagree with the  reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions  that I'm on the losing end of :) The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I  don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching  the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is  patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when  I get a chance.

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's  not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with  full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local  use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above  technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for  everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This  just makes it a little bit faster. gary _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list;1;0

to get reasonable net throughout most of the cafe. 

The rumor is that they'll be announcing that they've got boston covered on
the 21st.  I've heard from at least one source that they're actually going
to announce a much wider national rollout at that time.  It's not cheap [1], but

The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'. 2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite: rpm will try to support users who ""forgot"" to _leave off_ the leading '%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4. Confused? Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what I found ""documented"" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes: Line 46: 	- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config only. Line 49: 	- bail on %files macro. Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro? Line 172-174: 	- add ""rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)"" to track 	    %post -p ""/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib"" 	  incompatibilities. I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:   1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If      you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:      error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib   2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later. > --  > On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me >        A badly configured newsreader >  > _______________________________________________ > RPM-List mailing list  > http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list >  _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list";1;0

[last message before I unsub]

It's a very poor comparison.

There is no question as to what Ebay's trust model is. It's
completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.

Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""

The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.

Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.

Sure, but one can surmise that the ""Star Rating"" or feedback isn't an

It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced mature sperm when grafted in mice. ""It might work for primates or even humans,"" claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study.  If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy their ability to make sperm. Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to mature and produce sperm. Infectious particles  The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer remission.  But the grafting approach ""would eliminate any possibility of passing cancer cells back to the patient,"" says reproductive biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University. However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some scientists wary of the idea. ""I would very much hesitate to say that it's something we should be doing,"" says reproductive biologist Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School. Castrated mice  In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or pig sperm. When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen for several weeks. Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. ""We think that's a very real application,"" she says. She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new contraceptives on human sperm production.

Extremely lucky.  The other way around would have toasted your

In order to autodetect soft RAID volumes at boot, you need to set the
partition type on all the relevant raw disk partitions to 0xFD.  I'm
not sure about the initrd stuff; as I don't use it myself.

1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
   folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

Well, yeah, but there's an easier way.

There's still MITM, but it requires a far higher capability, and is easier
to detect once you go beyond the scamed interaction of two parties, since
being manipulative in principle.

If you run your own mailserver, or have a say in what your host does, make 
him adopt STARTTLS.";1;0

Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.

A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

Subject: [SAtalk] 2.41/2.50 spamd/spamc problem


I noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -F
option was removed from spamd. 

This is fine because all of the HTML format mail seems to arrive
properly. However, messages that get tagged as Spam arrive as just html
source.

Is there any way around this? I would like all HTML/RTF messages to
retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. I would
accomplish this on 2.31 by using the ""-F 0"" flag when starting spamd.

Thanks!

Paul Fries

This is very good news! Will this allow for individual spam word file
preferences when spamassassin is running on a mailserver for multiple
users? This would be an outstanding addition if it can be done. Thanks
much for a great project.

I'm now twice a published author. Earlier in the week, I released my top 50
Mac OS X tips, which marks the only thing I've ever written that I expect
anyone to pay for. If you happen to use OS X, go check them out. My second
publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for converting Vinyl LPs
to CD, by way of your PC (how's that for alphabet soup). For the time being,
you can get it absolutely free, with the caveat that I'd appreciate some feed
back on what could be added to make it more useful (I'm considering some
screen shots for it if I get some time). What are you waiting for -- get
something free already.

With the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I opted to
make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian Stevens. I'm already
happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider had horrid customer
service, not to mention I now have a much geekier phone in the form of the
Kyocera QCP 6035 Palm powered unit. It's just larger than most Palm devices on
the market, but having the device integration is nice. It has all the
functionality of a Palm, with some Internet browsing capabilities and of
course, phone access. A built in speakerphone actually works better than I
expected, Now all I need to do is get more applications installed.

Of interest to anyone who signed up for emusic after Chris and I talked the
service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark of 1,000
Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising considering
they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news in terms of feature
expansion.

**GIF Movie Gear v3.02 [1129k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $40**

http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm

The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for me. I'm
of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story or illustrate a
concept -- not put something in motion just because you can. That said, for
anyone wanting to create animations, this tool makes it nice and easy. A
storyboard interface keeps you thinking like a movie maker as you build your
animated creations, which lends itself to helping anyone who'd like to get
from point A to point B in an orderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG,
AVI, BMP, and GIF formats, leaving your options open for creating animated
segments.

A little on the childish side, but this CD-Rom drive test is still very funny.
Watch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. If geek TV were
more like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says
more than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player
is required,.

Two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music video
industry in this quirky comedy. John Cusack and Tim Robbins make this comedy
work, starring as the two security guards as they send up all sorts of
Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh at the ridiculous predicaments
these two survive, as they are greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and
movie industry names. I'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list
this movie on a resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of
them, especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each
other. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's underground
classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant to those out there who
are looking to put it to the man. If you've ever hated the recording industry
and its in-crowd attitude, you'll love this film. A closing reference to
Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa Monica, which is a regular stop for me every
time I'm in the LA area, prompted me to want to watch the film for a second
viewing. The movie is humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really
grabs attention on the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one
will buy it anyway.

I've just got a few quick thoughts today.

First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's
Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of
web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It
gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether
you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring
and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found
from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the
outcome.

Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader
brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case,
offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That
certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that
started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd
expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that
already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see
the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on
the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority
of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're
moving on.

On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, CleverMedia is
sponsoring karaoke night at Gnomedex. According to the woman with her finger
on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in
the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's
Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at
CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun --
it's what they do for a living! Between Leo Laporte, Doc Searls, Steve Gibson,
Mark Thompson, Evan Williams, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly
to miss out.

Onward. Have a great day.

**Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II**

I don't want to mince any words, here. CodeWeavers has really hit a sweet spot
with their recently-released CrossOver Office product. This is, quite simply,
the fulfillment of the promise of the Wine Project. Using this slick little
app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully
functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running
Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice
cubes in the blasted lands.

Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver
Office and CrossOver Plugin (as we discussed yesterday) share an install
script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to
be launched individually from a shared window.

I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD
drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd
expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always
have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a
Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.

Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver
Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of
the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I
was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell
whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.

For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE
install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to
customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull
together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup.
Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer""
driver.

Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project
walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always
suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the
financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well
founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a
level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the
spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these
products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows
users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't
need to fear those losses any more.

A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you
well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a
case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply
wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs
their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems
to be the perfect pay model for Linux.

**Kernel Configuration - Part X**

Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux
kernel configuration.

There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question,
""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have
all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If
you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead
of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other
hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be
filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.

See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the
high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion
of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the
configuration has been pretty straightforward.

Tomorrow, we _will_ dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device
kernel configuration.

modem configuration to be too difficult. Linmodems.org takes on both these
issues with skill and ease. The site includes discussion on hardware, software
and chipsets. It also links to sites to walk you through the process of
setting up a winmodem in Linux. This is a great resource of your main

Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now, some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs **doing something about it**. And what about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider? Probably.

CNET Reviews  
|  |  **Dear readers,**  
It was a crushing blow to discover that Vindigo, my all-time-favorite Palm
app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks wasn't steep, but the principle of
paying for a former freebie was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though;
surprising myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd rather
dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.

That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that most of us
have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail accounts, most ""free"" Web
e-mailers have started charging for premium services or imposing strict
limitations on free accounts. Read our reviews of the four top services to see
what you get if you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you
want to stay spam-free.

Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app. The latest
version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare now offers a paid
version that lets you search and download without those annoying ads. Maybe
the best things in life are now those with a fee.

WorldCom woes dominate, BearShare 4.0 isn't what it used to be, and Jaguar
runs ahead of schedule.  
_\--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends_

**1** | **WorldCom:**  
I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other tech trends are
overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its fourth week as front-page news,
WorldCom woes continue to sap investor confidence. This week's big story: the
top execs from the company are standing silent against government accusations
of wrongdoing.  
---|---  
**2** | **BearShare 4.0:**  
This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer software was been completely
redesigned and comes in two flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This
is nice touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area: downloading
music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's tests, it had an abysmal
success rate at actually returning files.  
**3** | **Jaguar:**  
Who ever heard of an operating system release being early? Well, Apple is
managing to pull off the impossible; it intends to ship an update to OS X in
August, instead of the anticipated late fall time frame.  
**4** | **Warcraft III:**  
Ah, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and sit in front of your computer.
Warcraft III has just been released--right in time for the good weather.
GameSpot calls it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it

**5** | **America's Army:**  
As Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army
wants _you_ to play PC games. That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3
million developing its own title, and it has just launched a television
campaign to drum up interest. Apparently, the campaign is working, since CNET
users made America's Army a top search term last week.

**Battered stocks regain ground**  
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose
Thursday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet
portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also
helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11
percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on
28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year
low Wednesday.

Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug
firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14
percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P; 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent,
to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.

**With rebates, HP angles for PC sales**  
Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs. For
retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate
or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into
the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-
in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.  
 **HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13%**

**Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay**  
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have
been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal. The lawsuits, each
filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal
shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies'
fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for
PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory
filings on Thursday.  
 **EBAY INC 60.38 2.63%**

**SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss**  
Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by
unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the
second quarter. The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros
($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414
million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United
States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in
Commerce One.

**Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02**  
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on
the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating
from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results.
Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's
growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's
improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension.
Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the
analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's
fundamentals.

**Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill**  
Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights
relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the
Internet. At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would
place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

**Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holes**  
Sharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security
holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network,
according to researchers at Syracuse University. In an advisory posted
Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said
they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D
handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system,
giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be
input through the keypad or touch screen.

**Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in**  
A widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users
encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and
left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye Digital Security
issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on
could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network
Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

**ACLU: Don't rat out your customers**  
A clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers
to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous
critics. A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is
urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe
legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously
air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than
100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers
know if they're targets.

|  **Dear Readers,**  
With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us,
who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message
Boards. The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to
giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the
Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life
experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common
interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky
execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or
question in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

**Why I don't use firewalls**  
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear
of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of
our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit
heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and
if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open. More
Security and Virus Alerts discussions

**The scoop on USB 2.0**  
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer
peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what
is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be
compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar
questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will
bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

  * USB vs. USB 2.O
  * How to upgrade from USB 1.1 to 2.0?
  * USB 2.0 with reverse compatibility with USB 1.1?
  * More Hardware discussions 

**Windows XP not any faster than Windows 98SE?!**  
Many users have jumped ship and moved on to newer and supposedly better things
such as Windows XP, but what if it doesn't perform up to par and is actually
slower than the previous OS that you had? Check out this discussion; what's
newer may not always be faster. More Windows XP discussions

**Best type of backup system to use for someone that is indigent?**  
Backing up your hard-drive system sounds like a task for veteran, but is it?
In this discussion, a beginner is asking for sound advice on the best type of
backup system to use, and sure enough, he received a bunch of options to
choose from. If you're in that same boat and looking for the best ways to back
up some of that important data of yours, this discussion is for you. Have a
look. More Computer Newbies discussions

**Warning for kids and teens online**  
If you're a parent, this may be something that you may want to read about kids
online. I found it interesting enough to pass along because I know someday
I'll be faced with the same worries when my kids are out surfing the web. So
have a look, and if it doesn't interest you, pass it on to someone who may
find it informative.

CNET Electronics  
|  |  **Dear readers,**  
If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and landscapes, a fast
camera may not matter. But if you've ever missed a shot because your camera
was busy processing the previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to
you. We liked it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.**

**Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm**  ![Editors'
Choice](http://www.cnet.com/Images/Global/ed_choice_13x13.gif)  
The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era street photographers
with the Digilux 1. A combination of speed, manual control, and advanced
features helps this 4-megapixel camera provide a digital option to shutterbugs
with an eye for the decisive moment.

**Onkyo LS-V950: The complete package**  
This home-theater kit boasts a long list of enviable features, including
progressive-scan video output and as many inputs and outputs as most budget
A/V receivers. And it sounds nice, too.  
**Read the review |  Check prices**  
  
**Panasonic DMC-F7: The littlest Lumix**  
The baby of Panasonic's new Lumix digital camera line, this ultracompact
2-megapixel model offers Leica optics, a svelte design, and a solid, basic
feature set. But how does it fare when it comes to performance and image
quality? We slipped it in our shirt pocket and went out for a shoot to find
out.

**Toshiba Pocket PC e740: 400MHz in your hand**  
Powered by Intel's new 400MHz XScale processor and boasting integrated Wi-Fi
connectivity, Toshiba's new PDA is an impressive mobile machine. We got hands
on with it to test the new chips and its myriad features. See how it did.

**Samsung DVD-P721M: Sticking out in a crowd**  
Samsung's affordable DVD-P721M not only offers progressive-scan playback but
also has a built-in Memory Stick slot. Is this the ideal DVD deck for owners
of Sony digital cameras, camcorders, and MP3 players? Read the review to find

This new flash-based MP3 player blew us away right out of the box, with its
slick styling, 128MB of expandable memory, in-line remote control, and low
price. The fact that it can encode WMA files in real time from any line-level
audio source is the icing on an already very tasty cake.

Check back later this week for our review of the Sony CLIE PEG-T665C. This
Palm OS 4.1 PDA has a built-in audio player so that you can listen to MP3s on
the go as well as a 66MHz processor for better video playback. But with OS 5
expected before Christmas, is now the time to buy a high-end Palm?

**Moore: Speech recognition next hurdle**  
Speech recognition will be the next transforming technology, but that
transformation may take another 50 years, says Intel co-founder Gordon Moore.
Honored this week with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Moore took time to
talk about the slowing down of his well-known law, the economy, philanthropic
priorities, and more.

**Cyberterrorists don't care about your PC**  
Forget about viruses. America's real cybersecurity concerns are the
notoriously vulnerable computer systems that control our **power and water
supplies**. Robert Vamosi offers a few ideas about how to keep the
infrastructure safe.

**Tech shores up Homeland Defense**  
Computer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President
Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed
the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity.
But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about
**tech-savvy terrorists** \--and insisting any new agency must shield the U.S.
from **electronic attacks** as well.

**Novell's new identity**  
Novell seems to understand where today's sweet spot is: providing enterprises
with the tools they need to manage and deliver **Web services** against the
identities of employees, partners, and customers. Novell, a leading Web
services company? It just may pull it off, says Tech Update's **Eric Knorr**.
Are you looking for solutions to your **identity crisis**? Do you think Novell
can provide them?

**ROI calculators don""t tell the whole TCO story**  
In response to David Berlind""s  **Dell's formula for ROI**, TCO consultant
**Tom Rankin** warns that ""99 percent of TCO tools do not look at the 'total'
but may look at whatever parameters suit the vendor to sell their
products/services."" His advice to clients: ""Make sure they can write a check
to the CFO after three months.""

Valley: A way out?**

The controversy over digital file swapping is no closer to an amicable
resolution than it was when peer-to-peer technology first came into vogue.

Charlie Cooper, Executive Editor/Commentary

**Just desserts for scofflaws**  
U.S. Rep. **Howard L. Berman** weighed in this week, arguing that piracy over
P2P networks robs songwriters on a massive scale. The congressman from
Hollywood has authored a bill to stop illegal digital downloads by giving
copyright owners the ability to technologically impair the distribution of
copyrighted works.  
**Read Full Story** ![](http://home.cnet.com/i/ne/ds/right_arrow.gif)

**Spotting a scam in sheep's clothing**  
Berman's proposal received a cool reception in Silicon Valley, where rules are
frowned upon and unfettered innovation reigns supreme. So it was that
StreamCast CEO **Steve Griffin** spoke for many in the community when he wrote
that Berman's proposal won't work. What's more, he wondered, was Berman really
concerned about controlling piracy, or could the congressman from Hollywood be
influenced by certain constituents? Conspiracy buffs this week had a field
day.  
**Read Full Story** ![](http://home.cnet.com/i/ne/ds/right_arrow.gif)

**How to curb digital piracy**  
The odds that either side will raise the white flag are slim. But must this
debate necessarily turn into an endless donnybrook? Former White House staffer
**Jonathan Greenblatt** doesn't buy into historical determinism, and believes
Hollywood can respond to the challenge of new media. First, it must shy away
from any legislation that aims to control technology or enforces any
""draconian"" digital rights management rules. What other suggestions does he
offer? Read on.  
**Read Full Story** ![](http://home.cnet.com/i/ne/ds/right_arrow.gif)

  
**Writing file sharing's final chapter**  
All this occurs as the P2P community lost one of its brighter lights. Computer
scientist and entrepreneur **Gene Kan** died June 29. Kan, who helped to
develop an early open-source version of Gnutella software, wrote a column for
CNET News.com on June 21, drawing on the lessons learned from the history of
peer-to-peer technology. In this highly nuanced piece, Kan offers a timely
warning about what can happen when people get overly excited about new
technologies.

**CEOs: Are you too focused?**  
Conventional wisdom has it that ""focus"" is de rigueur for any corporation
hoping to achieve superior performance. The flip side of this argument is that
markets are quick to discount the valuations of diversified companies because
of perceived shortcomings. But researchers at McKinsey offer an alternative
idea, suggesting that there's a particularly fertile middle ground between
focus and diversification.

We have reviewed these products, compared each to five products with similar features, and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the ""Price-Feature Ratio Analysis."" Featured products can fall in to three stages of Price-Feature ratios: Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one. Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability in prices among products with similar features. It pays to comparison shop for the best price. Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to find the right one for you. We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement to aid your shopping experience. ______________________________________________________________ Featured Products 1) Sound Blaster Extigy 2) Handspring Treo 90 3) KDS Rad-5 15-inch LCD 4) Sony PlayStation 2 ______________________________________________________________ Sound Blaster Extigy sound convergence device The Lowdown: If you're into watching DVDs, listening to tunes, or recording music with your computer, you'd be doing yourself a favor by upgrading your sound with this convergence device.

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people speak from
personal and professional experience. Draw your own conclusions. Lockergnomie
Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have zero liability for a fraudulent
transaction, the paperwork and red tape to work through if someone empties out
all your funds can leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards
that now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact your
credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a plan added to your
card or if you can apply for one that does."" And Russ Coover continues: ""If
you purchase something with a credit card, and you later decide to dispute the
purchase (for a reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses
to replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can legally
dispute the charge with your credit card company. However, if you use a debit
card to make that purchase, you have no right to dispute the charge.""

Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in question (E):
""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if you give your financial
institution timely notice of the theft of your card or PIN code (two business
days), you are liable for no more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up
to $500."" And Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your liability for $50,
with the possibility that your next charge might not go through because the
thief used all of your available balance. If a false charge goes against your
debit card and wipes out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can
bounce. Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25 insufficient fund
fees - and they are under no obligation to waive those fees. If you have 5
checks outstanding, you could be out over $100.""

Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my debit card
number through a local grocery store. I was told by the checker at the grocery
store that the card readers would only accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was
very suspicious, and used my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's
computer had been hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was reviewing my
checking account online two days later, and noticed an unauthorized charge
against my account ($60.00). I contacted the vendor that had charged my
account and informed them of the fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the
shipment, provided the shipping address to my bank, and credited my account
within 5 days after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact that I had to
request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""

Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally sure on
this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for online purchases.
Yes, you may not be liable for any of the false charges on a debit card (in
the end), but in the meantime (during your dispute) the money will be withheld
from your account and you will not have access to it. However with a credit
card, you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The scenario I
was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your debit card and cleaned
out your checking account? The money is gone! False charges on a credit card
are not ""real money"" until somebody has to pay them. I would guess that each
bank has different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what you use or
where you choose to use your plastic.

See You in August,  
Chris Pirillo

{Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects something. In fact,
just the other day I decided to start collecting dust. It's much easier than
collecting stamps. If you do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help
you keep track of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars
trading card collection, or your coin collection, or your [insert collection
here] collection. It works for everything, get it? It's also great for
managing your MP3 lists, including ID3 tag editing. ""CYG is founded on an

{Drive your drivers} Everyone else step outside while I have a talk with the
power geeks. If you're running on NT, 2000, or XP and need to know what
drivers you have running on your system, this program can show you. That's not
too shabby, but of course, you can also change or even get rid of certain
drivers if you desire. And that's, um, even more not too shabby. And that
Refresh button is there to make sure you're seeing everything exactly how you
want it. ""DriverManager is a tool designed to allow System Administrators,
Power Users and Driver Developers an easy means to view, modify or remove

""This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server. Mostly it is
useful for sites like FlamingText.com and ImageBot.com to send generated
images to another server (such as your Web or FTP server). This is
particularly useful for WebTV users who can't save images on their own
machine. Although we have no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers
that you do through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you are talking to
a slow server, your job may not complete in time. Other transloaders sometimes
suffer from overloading (too many people using them), which is why I wrote
this one. Hopefully, this will never happen to us, but in any case, check
these others out, they have some nice services...""

**To Share or Not to Share**  
Scribbled by Lee Smith

I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is being
shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I do not believe in
it. I can't consider it stealing because you can't steal from someone who
willingly puts the file up for downloading. Those who did put the file online
most likely feel that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are attempting to
make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel they have the right to
dictate what songs I can listen to or when or in what order. I like to rip
specific songs from CDs then make my own CD, which either goes down to my
entertainment system or to my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played
(""why"" is explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for my
truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs stolen, it would
be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a master. Sometimes, masters
cannot be replaced without a large expense, if at all.

If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not available
anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song being sought is wanted
to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I do believe in that, too. Case in
point: as a kid, I collected a lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than
4,000 records in my collection. Many were played so much that they are not
playable anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to relive some
of my younger days through music, but attempting to convert those records (to
digital) is next to impossible for me. So, in this instance, no, I do not
think it is illegal to seek out digitalized copies of the old songs that I
already have records of (albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I
am seeking are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.

For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one day, perhaps I
will reach a point with technology (and money) where I can transfer those
platters to WAV and they will sound as good as when they were originally
recorded. I have been lucky enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet;
I was quick to purchase the disc, usually from the original artists
themselves. Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem to care
about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are released.

Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital video camera
purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: ""I see that you're thinking of getting a
DV camera. I got one about a month ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get
one with A/V INPUTS. Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your
digital stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to get
VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only can you get your
old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can use the camera as a pass-
through device and get the old stuff directly onto your computer for editing
purposes. I wish someone had made clear the advantages and importance of
inputs when I bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But if you're
going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you want to work on any of
your old stuff). Don't make the same mistake I did - make SURE you get this
feature. It doesn't seem to impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and
some don't."" This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 

I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. 

Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. 

And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. 

There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a

Should it be 38K4 - a fairly common baudrate for serial port
connections? Though if you are getting this much, the baudrate
may be right. It looks like high ASCII so it may also be worth
playing with the tty type (ANSI/VT etc).

> How do I find out the time a file was created at?
 
 There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
 available. If you check out how struct stat is defined on your system,
 you'll find that only

     time_t   st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
     time_t   st_mtime;    /* Time of last data modification */
     time_t   st_ctime;    /* Time of last file status change */
                           /* Times measured in seconds since */
                           /* 00:00:00 UTC, Jan. 1, 1970 */

 are available. File status change = i-node status change, it includes
 creation, mode change, ownership change etc., so this is what you want
 only if the file status wasn't changed since creation.

 This information is also shown by ls -lc, but parsing ls' output requires
 a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend to write a short C program to access
 the file status directly, and output the ctime directly (seconds since
 the epoch, i.e. perfect for numerical comparison).

 (Another way is to use GNU find -printf with a custom format:
  ...
            %c   File's last  status  change  time  in  the  format
               returned by the C `ctime' function.
 ...)

2680;Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>;ilug@linux.ie;Thu, 1 Aug 2002 15:51:12 +0100;[ILUG] Strange ssh problem;"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. 

I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).

In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.

We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is below

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1
debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)

whereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log went

debug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password

and before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:

1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)


This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

That reminds me of a Robin William's routine from the 80's concerning his

impressed.

* Handwriting recognition was good, as was the ability to parse text from
diagrammatic or graphic elements.
* TabletPC form factors, while not perfect, are quite usable (light,
relatively thin, some can convert from laptop to tablet use by flipping the
screen).
* Pushbutton switching between portrait and landscape screen orientation.
* TabletPCs I saw came with built-in WiFi.
* Good to very good integration of handwriting into existing applications,
and there is a very nice new note-taking application specifically for
handwritten notes.
* Good set of APIs for adding handwriting into existing applications (at the
most simple, it's only a few additional lines of code)
* Prices of the hardware will be around mid-range laptop (will vary by
model)

I believe the TabletPC will be very successful, and is a much bigger deal
than the relative lack of press coverage would suggest. I'm definitely
starting to think about how I could incorporate one into my routine...

For example, the simplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out each character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example, Zhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong', then you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the most common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for the second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3. You can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that much different to English.  However, until you get familiar with the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can be a little slow. Other input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the phonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost always pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is 'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to the possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent 'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd enter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible matches. I think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where you can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only use that when you know the character you want but you don't know how to pronounce it. >  >  some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line, >  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?). >  also, some(/most?)

Probably most often Ctrl-Space.  That's what the Microsoft Global Input Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC. Regarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me on Red Hat 7.2 o  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The    fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable    Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMs o  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging    in. Everything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in your GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the menus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your way around. Use Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When  in Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't understand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use Ctrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space. Fire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and  you'll see the Chinese for China. Getting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left as an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account 
on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial e-
mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?

Actually you would be inaccurate in your action in a way. The correct  behavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing  list. But in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be  the only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get  hurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense).  If you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense).  If there is no majority, nobody wins or lose. Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority,  not for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he  should use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't  razor provide a razor-blacklist too?)

I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of
report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the
one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the
majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your
trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither
against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor
bad, just... gray)

Oh goodie. My final year project rears its head :-)

Much as I would like to answer an unqualified ""yes"", I must admit: if 
you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the 
same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the 
same as when the manuals on ""modular coding"" said to write modules that 
would fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded 
to split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)

However, ""Go-to considered harmful"" points out that to analyse (==debug) 
code, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and 
what the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) 
job if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if 
it uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF 
for the full letter).

Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC 
at an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard 
offspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of 
hand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used 
GOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - 
you always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the 
benefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months 
time) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the 
hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.

Yes a clever term usually (and deservedly) attributed to perl.
Of course you can create write-only code in any language.
There's even a competition for obfuscated C code which is always
worth a look: http://www.es.ioccc.org/main.html

Pdraig.

p.s. what sort of processing do you do with:

In the slashdot thread about

Referring to his ""Goto considered harmful"" etc.

Sad to see these people go. 3 others I've

and Jon Postel.

Dude, take that one up with Redhat, Suse, IBM or any of the other folks using the name of a public project (i.e. Linux) for a commercial product.  ;-) This is not only a concept with precedent it's actually quite common. rw2 ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk";1;0

Something tells me Adam's security blanket was very wet and that Adam had a propensity for throwing it on his stuffed animals.

Getting your own domain needn't be expensive, looks more professional, and
you're not going to suddenly lose your site with little or no notice (yes,
I'm still smarting from bastard Geocities). I registered mine through
http://www.easyspace.com/ - works out about a pound a week for registration
and 30Mb hosting. It's a valuable service, there's no reason not to expect
to pay.

I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
 However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

the relevant folder using rcvstore.

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.

There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.

It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
configure that probably.

Any idea how I would do this?

Thanks
Siva

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

          the perl modules.

  - spamassassin

          the ""spamassassin"" and ""spamd"" scripts,
          spamd rc-file etc.

  - spamassassin-tools

          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
          for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

And it is pretty common practice in some environments with public

with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)

We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,
A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
Everyone you meet is your mirror.

You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
waste what you do have.

The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be
in the Eternal Now Moment

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

The
purpose
of our lives
is to be free
of all addictive traps,
and thus
become one
with the ocean of
Living Love.

Date: Not supplied

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. 

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned. 

  

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the 
brown WiFi, the brown WiFi is BAD (_Thanks, Rob!_)

Date: Not supplied

We did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with 
Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV 
recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights. Glenn ""802.11b Networking News"" Fleishman took great 
notes through the talk: 

    Dan: Tim, you're a ""content or copyright holdertalk about these issues."" 

    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. 
    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is 
    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the 
    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. 

    Oblivion is fate of most books: ""Piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books."" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators. ""Piracy is a marginal act; it takes 
    away some of the cream."" 

    Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores. 

    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will 
    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? 

    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media 
    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're 
    stuck for a long time with ""some mistakes.""

Dan Gillmor's column this week is all about Apple's burgeoning resistance to 
the Hollywood onslaught on general-purpose computing: 

    Intel's doing it. Advanced Micro Devices is doing it. Microsoft is doing 
    it. 

    Apple Computer isn't. 

    What's Apple not doing? It's not -- at least so far -- moving toward an 
    anti-customer embrace with Hollywood's movie studios and the other members 
    of the powerful entertainment cartel.

Date: Not supplied

All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: 

    Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema 

    In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

    *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd

    *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
    ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
    Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
    to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
    the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 

    Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."" 

    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 

    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.

I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;

Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00

Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. 

Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 

Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: 

- New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 

(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 

Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. 

- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. 

Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

InfoSpace CEO to step down

BELLEVUE, Wash. AP) - InfoSpace Inc. chairman and chief executive Naveen 
Jain will step down from his posts once the Internet services and software 
company finds a replacement.

Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led 
the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was 
announced Wednesday.

With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being 
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders 
to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If 
approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for 
one new share.

The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past, 
including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned 
last year after just nine months on the job.

The company said Jain will remain as a company employee.

Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

How hot it feels is affected by both temperature and humidity.  In 
Mississippi they have lots of humidity, in the Southwest, we don't.

As I know from experience, Mississippi feels a lot hotter at 90 degrees F. 
than home (Santa Fe) does at 90.

Perhaps the military didn't want to train in a real desert because 1) it 
get's over 100 degrees and any time the air temp is greater than body temp 
it affects performance, and 2) when those troops go to a real desert 
they'll think it's so much nicer than Mississippi.

No, I'm not maligning Mississippi.  I had a great time passing through last 
year on vacation.

Peace,

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin

          Platform: Other

        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

and my stats:

 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

------- Additional Comments From mgm@starlingtech.com  2002-10-03 21:46 -------
Looks great! One note: most ""image-only"" spam actually has some text (a few 
words at the top, a disclaimer at the end) so keep that in mind. The typical 
image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image, 
then a bit more.

Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).

===============

The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total.

Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 31.25%

=========================

I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.

This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

The default score for bondedsender-certified domains is -10, but I do not
believe they should be trusted and encourage you to change the default.

* I have been spammed by their customers.
* There is no documentation on their website about how I can complain about
  this and have their customers financially penalized for sending me unsolicited
  mail.
* What proof do any of us have that they really even do anything about it?
  Their contract is with their customers, not with us.

This is a scam!  Don't trust them!

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2.""

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either. 
 
> So I'm *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff. 2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5 for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's the problem! 3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.

Hmmm, my last message doesn't seem to have made it into bugzilla yet.

I've committed a patch to fix this problem in both HEAD and b2_4_0.  The last
message explains what the problem was and what the patch does to fix it.

Well that exploit requires an executable stack so it won't happen on a

Hijacker High (8/30)
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in  
the suburbs of Washington.  That's far more effectual than blowing  
oneself up in a bus.

In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political  
doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant.  But random violence  
is entertainment and intrigue.

A couple of ex-FBI ""consultants"" speaking on the shootings in DC were  
quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a  
""heroin-like high"" from each successful kill and that they ""for  
whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose  
at law enforcement and society.""

See?  Just a couple of kids having fun with Daddy's semi-automatic  
hunting rifle.  Harmless!

Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in
Montreal, Canada.

http://star.itc.it/wse2002/

- Jim

>>From the Web page:

 The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is
becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static
information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards
and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing
Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.

The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.

WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):

*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution

WSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.

As Kevin said, the problem can reputedly be solved using Donald Becker's 
Linux-native utilities for the 3C5X9 series.  Turn off PnP, and then set 
the IRQ and I/O base address as required.  Make sure those are also
made available in the motherboard BIOS Setup program to ""Legacy ISA
devices"" or whatever it's called, there.

I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.

However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...

Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.

This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.

I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.

Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?

There's a switch statement in the program on argv[0].

It's not including any options in the link.

I took some time out to make  RPMs of GStreamer for it. All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt  repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory. The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for  the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro  contains all the necessary packages. A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms : a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't  have a -devel package for it yet b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve. Here are the errors: INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0:  undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin  ""/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so"" INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so failed to load: Error loading plugin  /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so:  undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0 I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib  reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must  be something straightforward that should fix this.

Venture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off
By LYNNLEY BROWNING

The venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like
a brawling barroom.

Venture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly
hard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or
original backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for
money, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are
even suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are
wiping out the value of their previous investments.

""People are playing hardball,"" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at
Charles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.

The bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out
many venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks
and limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,
venture capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,
""private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture
capitalists that we have seen in 20 years,"" said Steven E. Bochner, a
securities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,
who represents venture firms.

In the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two
options. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits
and receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into
common stock when the private company held an initial public offering or
was sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired
companies, they usually chose No. 2.

But with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers
and acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast
are increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This ""double dip,""
known as ""participating preferred,"" leaves far less potential wealth for a
company's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also
negotiating more deals with heightened ""liquidation preferences,"" in which
start-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three
times over.

Previously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump
sum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when
the new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,
or the hiring of a particular chief executive.

They are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that
permit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who
might dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate
department at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.
Borden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular
venture capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those
backers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.

ENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists
have been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the
prices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less
when it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a ""full
ratchet,"" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.
But it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's
original investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the
company for a song.

""If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get
crushed"" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,
general partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,
based in Wellesley Hills, Mass.

Consider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three
rounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110
million from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia
Capital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of
Goldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at
more than $180 million.

Last month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul
Venture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the
company for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only
$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But
most of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,
leaving almost no value for existing investors.

Despite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors
chose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,
""there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous
investments,"" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.
""We were all completely washed out"" in the last round, said the investor,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

There is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.
Venture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are
private and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities
lawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.
""At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,"" said
Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a
trade group based in Arlington, Va.

The shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture
capitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall
Street's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own
investors and to justify their management fees.

Venture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new
company. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent
investor. ""We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the
benefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,"" said Todd Dagres,
a general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.

Some entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no
other way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the
investors, whom they call ""vulture capitalists,"" bent on picking the meat
off a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists ""want to
take advantage of you,"" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike
Force Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,
N.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months
because they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales
milestones.

George J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New
York that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms
had even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured
with receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned
them all down.

NOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture
firms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the
companies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.

In one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley
firm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial
this month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial
services concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before
the Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million
round that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to
raise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half
the company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,
unspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the
money. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware
judge threw out last week.

Such friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated
like a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one
another. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in
tighter markets, ""there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,"" said Mr.
Bochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. ""There's going to be much more
litigation like this.""

A Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected
By PHILIP SHENON

WASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday
by Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the
House and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for
Americans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.

After the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun
to receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to
file bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.

""I've had plenty of calls this morning,"" said Gary F. Weltmann, a
consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. ""And I'm telling people that
they need to take action now.""

Marty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was
""getting ready for the onslaught.""

""I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,""
he said.

The White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,
which was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in
the Senate next week. 

""The president looks forward to signing that,"" said Ari Fleischer, the
White House spokesman. ""That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support
for good reasons."" 

The bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate
conference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more
than a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday
after agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final
obstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters
from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a
result of clinic protests.

The bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card
and banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the
bankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to
pay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up
19 percent from 2000.

""This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our
bankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one
while cracking down on those who don't,"" said Representative F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.

Critics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a
gift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign
contributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do
harm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost
jobs, poor health or divorce.

The bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,
which comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive
accounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of
the same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for
the bankruptcy bill.

""The timing couldn't be worse,"" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative
director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""It takes a lot of gall
for Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are
concerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky."" 

Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of
the bill, said today that ""it boggles the mind that at a time when
Americans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need
of protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major
financial safety net in our society for the middle class.""

Bankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and
middle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take
them years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free ""fresh start""
that many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.

Recent studies have shown that the average American filing for
bankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average
of about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last
year showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that
was six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had
medical debts exceeding $1,000.

""I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,""
said Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the
Bankruptcy Center. ""But there are honest, hard-working folks who are
really going to be affected by these changes.""

The bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes
in their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the
federal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their
unsecured debts, like credit card bills.

Debtors with an income above the state median would be barred from
filing under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead
under Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be
repaid over time under the court-administered plan.

Mr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would ""hurt
a lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.""

""My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and
they've just got heavy debt,"" he said. ""You can always find some
circumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and
got themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old
poor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that
the credit card companies make to Congress.""

At its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now
remain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few
niches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is
file sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative
economic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording
industry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer
auctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail
may have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely
they failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the
public's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the
art has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found
satisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter
unwritten.

XML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have
the ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT
policies such as security, routing, performance, management,
transformation, and connection provisioning.  Current firewalls aren't
able to peek in the envelope and decipher XML traffic, said report
author Ronald Schmelzer, ZapThink senior analyst.  XML proxies are not
only able to understand network protocols, but also the XML-based
content traveling on top of those protocols, Schmelzer said.  ZapThink
identifies a slew of new vendors with XML-ready security solutions,
including Flamenco Networks, Forum Systems, Reactivity, Vordel, and
Westbridge Technology, among others... ZapThink estimates that XML
represents just 2 percent of network traffic today, but that will
increase to almost 25 percent by 2006.

I do not have the time to follow the compiler ""wars"", but I notice that I
must use egcs to build 64 bit SPARC code.

GCC 3 should do it, but because it is so ""buggy""[1] it is not worth trying
to use unless you really want to track down those compiler errors... :(

- Matthew

[1] ""buggy"" in the sense that its a feature. Many of the problems with GCC 3
seem to be related to stricter syntax checking. More accurate information
will be appreciated.
